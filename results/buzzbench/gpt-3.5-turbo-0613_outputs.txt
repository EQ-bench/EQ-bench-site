#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
And on his team tonight: 

Get off the Dog and Bone and rush down the Apples and Stairs, you'll never guess who's on the Bella Vision jet… It's cheeky Cockney and movie star, Danny Dyer! 

And from ratings-winning band The Long Blondes, it's the lead singer we've all very much heard of… Please don't turn off… It's Kate Jackson! 

And on Phil's team tonight: 

Look, it's the drummer from McFly! They totally appeal to me and my demographic. I'm going to watch this. It's Harry from McFly! 

He's a comedian and actor from the Flight of the Conchords. You can talk all the way through if you like, as long as you keep the TV on. It's Rhys Darby!

# Danny Dyer's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Danny Dyer's introduction revolves around wordplay and the play on phrases commonly used in Cockney rhyming slang.

The humor relies on the audience's understanding and recognition of the rhyming slang, as well as their appreciation for the exaggerated use of it in the introduction.

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Mark's team tonight, she's usually chasing pavements, but tonight, pavements, you can take the evening off because she's not chasing you, she's chasing points! It's song sensation and points for Sugar Nut, Adele. Also on Mark's team, not that we're panicking about the loss of anyone in particular, but it's comedian with a piano, Tim, just in case, Minchin.  And on Phil's team tonight, "Honk! Honk!" That's the sound of a klaxon. But what does this one sound like? Like a bloody cool human, we hope, it's one of The Klaxons, Jamie Reynolds from The Klaxons! And Phil's second guest is an actor with the charisma and talent to make anything he's in, however bad the script, seem like it certainly should be good enough for BBC3. It's Ralf Little, everybody!

# Test Model Analysis

Judge Analysis: The model identified the basic pun but missed the intentionally tortured, self-aware nature of the joke and the 'meshuggener' element completely. Its analysis is superficial, focusing only on the surface wordplay without recognizing the meta-humor of the deliberately strained setup. Theory of mind analysis is generic and lacks insight into why this type of self-aware corniness works for this show's audience. Funniness ratings are close but slightly off, missing why it works as anti-humor.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 09: Mark Watson, Christopher Biggins, Robyn, Sam Duckworth

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight, he's on every other TV show to celebrate his "King of the Jungle" triumph; one more won't hurt, surely? It's Christopher Biggins! And taking advantage of nothing else being released at the moment, it's indie sensation and big fish in an empty pond, Get Cape Wear Cape Fly!

Phil's first guest is a chart-topping pop phenomenon whose album is still nearly full price in many shops; it's Robin! And he also has a brilliant comedian and a talented author, yet strangely available during such a busy time for comedy and books, it's Mark Watson!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Christopher Biggins' intro
**Intended Humour**

# Get Cape Wear Cape Fly's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Get Cape Wear Cape Fly's introduction revolves around the phrase "indie sensation and big fish in an empty pond." The humor lies in the juxtaposition of being an "indie sensation," which typically implies a certain level of success and popularity, with the image of being a "big fish in an empty pond," which suggests that there is no real competition or audience for their music.

# Robin's intro
**Intended Humour**

# Mark Watson's intro
**Intended Humour**

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is the lead singer with The Foals... Well if their recent invasion of January is anything to go by, I wouldn't want to be February right now. It’s Yannis Philippakis.

And an award-winning stand-up who fuses comedy with music, he could be a bit like Bill Bailey if it wasn't for his grotesquely freakish, almost non-human appearance. It's the very different to Bill Bailey, Tim Minchin everybody!

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Phil's first guest is the lead singer with The Foals... Well if their recent invasion of January is anything to go by, I wouldn't want to be February right now. It’s Yannis Philippakis.

**Intended Humour:**
The joke in this introduction is a pun based on wordplay. The phrase "if their recent invasion of January is anything to go by" is a play on the idea of the band "The Foals" invading January. By stating "I wouldn't want to be February right now," it implies that February is the next month to be invaded by the band. The humor comes from the unexpected connection between a band and a month and the exaggerated idea of a band "invading" a month.

**How it Lands:**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience watching at home. The pun is clever and unexpected, which can elicit a chuckle or a snort from the audience. The humor relies on the audience's ability to make the connection between the band and the month, which may require some background knowledge or familiarity with the band. Overall, it is a light-hearted joke that is likely to be well-received by the show's typical audience.

**Funniness Ratings:**
- Audience at home: 3. An audible snort.
- Comedy writer: 4. LOL.

# And an award-winning stand-up who fuses comedy with music, he could be a bit like Bill Bailey if it wasn't for his grotesquely freakish, almost non-human appearance. It's the very different to Bill Bailey, Tim Minchin everybody!

**Intended Humour:**
The humor in this introduction comes from a comparison between Tim Minchin and Bill Bailey. The joke plays on the idea that Tim Minchin is similar to Bill Bailey in terms of fusing comedy with music but emphasizes that he is different due to his "grotesquely freakish, almost non-human appearance." The humor here lies in the exaggerated description of Tim Minchin's appearance and the contrast created between the two comedians.

**How it Lands:**
This joke may land well with the audience watching at home, but it also has the potential to be divisive. The humor relies on the audience's familiarity with Bill Bailey and their ability to appreciate the exaggerated description of Tim Minchin's appearance. Some viewers may find the joke amusing due to the unexpected and exaggerated nature of the description, while others may find it offensive or mean-spirited. It is important to note that humor is subjective, and what may be funny to some may not be to others.

**Funniness Ratings:**
- Audience at home: 2. A minor exhale out the nose.
- Comedy writer: 3. An audible snort.

In conclusion, the introduction for Yannis Philippakis contains a pun-based joke that is likely to be well-received by the show's audience, while the introduction for Tim Minchin relies on a comparison and an exaggerated description that may divide the audience's response.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 06: Christmas Special - Vic Reeves, Myleene Klass, Matt Bowman, Mark Ronson

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight:
Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ, the everlasting lord, he put the Wine into Winehouse, it's irresponsible cool dude producer, Mark Ronson.
And you can be the hottest, you can be the finest, it don't matter to me, it's one half of my favourite double act in the history of I'm a Celebrity, it's Vic from Vic and Nancy.

On Bill's team:
Oh holy child of Bethlehem, descend on us we pray, it's the singer from the band The Pigeon Detectives who's interestingly called Matt Bowman, it's Matt Bowman.
And you could be the baddest, be the most stylish, you could be rolling in money, it's classically trained celebrity and reality TV mother, Myleene Klass.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Phil's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains two jokes. 

Joke 1: "Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ, the everlasting lord, he put the Wine into Winehouse, it's irresponsible cool dude producer, Mark Ronson."
Explanation: This joke plays on the name "Winehouse" and the phrase "put the wine in." The joke is a wordplay that suggests that Mark Ronson, as a producer, is responsible for Amy Winehouse's success and the "wine" in her name. The use of religious language, with the references to Christ and Bethlehem, adds a comedic element of exaggeration and unexpectedness. The juxtaposition of religious language with a humorous pop culture reference creates an unexpected twist, which is a common element of humor.

Joke 2: "And you can be the hottest, you can be the finest, it don't matter to me, it's one half of my favorite double act in the history of I'm a Celebrity, it's Vic from Vic and Nancy."
Explanation: This joke relies on the exaggeration of Phil's enthusiasm for Vic from Vic and Nancy, a double act from the reality show "I'm a Celebrity." The humor comes from Phil expressing his admiration for Vic, regardless of his physical appearance or attractiveness. The use of hyperbolic language emphasizes the absurdity of the statement, adding to the comedic effect. The reference to a specific double act also adds an element of specificity that may resonate with fans of the show.

**How it Lands**
Considering the typical audience of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks," which is a British comedy panel show, the jokes are likely to land well. The show's audience is familiar with wordplay, pop culture references, and exaggerated humor, making it likely that they will appreciate the comedic elements in these jokes.

From the perspective of the audience watching at home, the first joke might elicit an audible snort. The wordplay and unexpected twist of linking Mark Ronson to Amy Winehouse's success can be seen as clever and amusing.

From the perspective of a comedy writer, the first joke might also receive an audible snort. The use of religious language in a humorous context adds an additional layer of cleverness to the joke, making it more enjoyable for comedy writers.

The second joke might receive a minor exhale out the nose from the audience watching at home. While the joke relies on hyperbolic language and specific references to a reality show, it may not have the same universal appeal as the first joke.

From the perspective of a comedy writer, the second joke might also receive a minor exhale out the nose. While the exaggeration and specificity of the joke can be seen as amusing, it may not be as universally funny or clever as the first joke.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home:
- Joke 1: An audible snort (3)
- Joke 2: A minor exhale out the nose (2)

From the perspective of a comedy writer:
- Joke 1: An audible snort (3)
- Joke 2: A minor exhale out the nose (2)

# Bill's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains two introductions but no jokes.

Explanation: The first introduction introduces Matt Bowman, the singer from the band The Pigeon Detectives, and mentions his interesting name. While the mention of his name may be slightly amusing, it does not constitute a joke. The second introduction introduces Myleene Klass, referring to her as a "classically trained celebrity and reality TV mother." While the description adds some humor through exaggeration, it is not a joke in itself.

**How it Lands**
The lack of jokes in these introductions may result in a more neutral response from the audience. While the descriptions may elicit a minor exhale out the nose from some viewers, they may not generate a strong comedic reaction.

Considering the typical audience of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks," which appreciates wordplay, pop culture references, and exaggerated humor, these introductions may not land as well as the previous ones. The lack of clear jokes may result in a slightly lower comedic impact.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 04: Roy Stride, Bobby Davro, Kristen Schaal, Richard Fleeshman

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team, one of the biggest impression-based comedians of the 80s, now starring in Eastenders and doing a pretty good Shane Richie, it's Bobby Davro. Also on Phil's team, he's so lovely, he's so lovely, he's so lovely. He's released his second single, whatever it's called. From Scouting for Girls, it's Roy Stride. On Noel's team tonight, the former star of Coronation Street, star of soap star superstar, now starring as a pop star, even his album's got one star, it's Richard Fleeshman. And finally from cult comedy hit Flight of the Conchords, it's another one of those cutting edge American comedians. What's going on? Bring back Bobby Davro. Oh he's still here. It's Kristen Schaal.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Bobby Davro's intro
**Intended Humour**
The humor in Bobby Davro's introduction comes from the play on his impression-based comedy and his current role in Eastenders. The joke is that he used to do impressions in the 80s, but now he's doing a pretty good impression of Shane Richie, who is also a comedian and actor. The irony lies in the fact that Davro is known for his impressions, but now he's mimicking another comedian. This creates a humorous twist and highlights the contrast between his past and present career.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on a familiarity with Bobby Davro and Shane Richie, as well as an understanding of the concept of impression-based comedy. The humor is subtle but effective, as it plays on the audience's expectations and subverts them. Overall, it is a clever joke that is likely to elicit a minor exhale out the nose or an audible snort from the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
- Audience Watching at Home: 3 (An audible snort)
- Comedy Writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Roy Stride's intro
**Intended Humour**
The humor in Roy Stride's introduction comes from his association with the band Scouting for Girls and the mention of his second single. The joke lies in the fact that the introduction builds up his musical career as if it's something significant, but then dismisses it by saying "whatever it's called." This creates a humorous contrast between the hype surrounding his second single and the lack of importance given to its actual title.

**How it Lands**
The humor in this joke relies on the audience's familiarity with Scouting for Girls and their music. If the audience is aware of the band and their reputation, they are likely to find this joke amusing. However, if the audience is unfamiliar with the band, the joke may not land as well. Overall, the joke is moderately funny and may result in a minor exhale out the nose or an audible snort from the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
- Audience Watching at Home: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)
- Comedy Writer: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)

# Richard Fleeshman's intro
**Intended Humour**
The humor in Richard Fleeshman's introduction comes from the play on his career transition from Coronation Street to a pop star. The joke is that even though he is now a pop star, his album has only received one star. This creates a humorous contrast between his aspirations as a pop star and the lack of critical acclaim for his music.

**How it Lands**
This joke relies on the audience's familiarity with Richard Fleeshman and his career in Coronation Street. If the audience is aware of his transition to music, they are likely to find this joke amusing. The humor lies in the irony of his album having one star despite his ambitions as a pop star. Overall, this joke is likely to elicit an audible snort or a minor exhale out the nose from the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
- Audience Watching at Home: 3 (An audible snort)
- Comedy Writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Kristen Schaal's intro
**Intended Humour**
The humor in Kristen Schaal's introduction comes from the juxtaposition between her being described as a "cutting edge American comedian" and the sarcastic remark of "What's going on? Bring back Bobby Davro." The joke plays on the idea that the show is featuring another American comedian, but the speaker sarcastically suggests that they should bring back Bobby Davro instead. This creates a humorous contrast between the expectation of a cutting-edge comedian and the preference for a more traditional comedian like Davro.

**How it Lands**
This joke relies on the audience's familiarity with Bobby Davro and their understanding of the humor in the contrast between cutting-edge comedy and more traditional comedy. If the audience is aware of Davro's style and reputation, they are likely to find this joke amusing. The humor lies in the sarcastic remark, which adds a layer of irony to the introduction. Overall, this joke is likely to elicit an audible snort or a minor exhale out the nose from the audience.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 03: Dappy, Keith Chegwin, Tahita Bulmer, Rich Rulche

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Noel's team tonight, the leader of Mercury-nominated New Young Pony Club. She's so cool. None of you squares probably know who she is, but I do, because a researcher told me. It's Tahita Bulmer. 

Also on Noel's team is one of Britain's most loved early morning impromptu doorstep cash prize givers. It's recovering TV presenter, Keith Chegwin. 

Phil's first guest is from urban collective N-Dubz. This year he won a MOBO, which you may say is worthless. However, it does entitle him to a mammoth 20 nectar points and free entry to the Keswick Pencil Museum. It's Dappy, ladies and gentlemen. 

And his second guest is the mighty Bruce Star and friend of Noel Fielding, but that's not why he's here. It's quiz show asset and valid booking, Rich Fulcher.

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Tahita Bulmer's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction is the contrast between the statement that Tahita Bulmer is "so cool" and the sarcastic remark that "none of you squares probably know who she is." The humor comes from the irony that the audience may not actually be familiar with Tahita Bulmer, despite the assertion that she is cool.
- Another comedic element in this introduction is the self-awareness of the host, Noel Fielding, acknowledging that he only knows who Tahita Bulmer is because a researcher told him. This adds a layer of absurdity to the introduction.

**How it Lands**
- The joke about Tahita Bulmer being cool may land well with the show's typical audience, which is likely familiar with alternative and indie music. The humor relies on the audience's understanding and appreciation of the irony in the statement.
- The self-awareness of the host may also resonate with the audience, as it adds a humorous meta-commentary on the nature of celebrity and the research done for the show. This self-awareness may enhance the comedic effect for the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4. LOL

# Keith Chegwin's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction is the description of Keith Chegwin as "one of Britain's most loved early morning impromptu doorstep cash prize givers." The humor comes from the absurdity of this title, as it is a playful way of referring to Chegwin's past as a presenter on morning television shows where he would surprise people with cash prizes.
- The use of the phrase "recovering TV presenter" adds another layer of humor to the introduction, implying that Chegwin may have had a difficult past or is overcoming some challenges.

**How it Lands**
- The humor in this introduction may land well with the show's typical audience, as it plays on nostalgia for Chegwin's past television appearances and his reputation as an entertaining presenter.
- The absurdity of the title given to Chegwin may also elicit laughter from the audience, as it is unexpected and humorous.

**Funniness Ratings**
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4. LOL
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4. LOL

# Dappy's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction is the comparison between winning a MOBO (Music of Black Origin) award and its supposed worthlessness, followed by the exaggerated reward of "20 nectar points and free entry to the Keswick Pencil Museum." The humor comes from the contrast between the prestigious nature of the MOBO award and the mundane and absurd rewards that supposedly come with it.
- The mention of the Keswick Pencil Museum adds an element of randomness and absurdity to the introduction, as it is an unexpected and unrelated reward for winning a music award.

**How it Lands**
- The humor in this introduction may land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on the audience's understanding of the significance of the MOBO award and their willingness to find humor in the exaggerated and mundane rewards.
- The absurdity of the Keswick Pencil Museum as a reward may also elicit laughter from the audience, as it is unexpected and humorous.

**Funniness Ratings**
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4. LOL
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3. An audible snort

# Rich Fulcher's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction is the contrast between Bruce Star being referred to as the "mighty" and the statement that his presence is not because he is a friend of Noel Fielding. The humor comes from the irony that the introduction is highlighting Bruce Star's association with Noel Fielding while simultaneously denying it as the reason for his presence on the show.
- The use of the terms "quiz show asset" and "valid booking" adds another layer of humor to the introduction, as it playfully emphasizes the importance of having Bruce Star on the show without directly acknowledging his connection to Noel Fielding.

**How it Lands**
- The humor in this introduction may land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on their familiarity with the dynamics and relationships among the show's regular guests and hosts.
- The irony and self-awareness in the introduction may enhance the comedic effect for the audience, as it adds a layer of absurdity to the statement about Bruce Star's presence.

**Funniness Ratings**
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4. LOL

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 08: Jon McClure, KT Tunstall, Lauren Laverne, Jeremy Edwards

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight... it's award-winning singer-songwriter KT Tunstall. Phil's second guest presents the Culture Show and recently became a mother. Ooh, isn't she highbrow and fertile! What's she going to do next, give birth to the Venus de Milo whilst wearing glasses? It's Lauren Laverne. Bill's first guest is from Sheffield indie electro funk legends Reverend and the Makers. While some pop shows will content themselves with just any old "Maker", we've only gone and got the actual "Reverend"! It's actually Reverend Jon McClure! And finally, it's former Hollyoaks, Holby City, and Rachel Stevens' hunk, now concentrating on solo hunk projects. It's the Incredible Hunk, Jeremy Edwards!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# KT Tunstall's intro
**Intended Humor**
The joke in KT Tunstall's intro is a play on words using a combination of highbrow and fertile. The phrase "Ooh, isn't she highbrow and fertile!" implies that KT Tunstall is not only intellectually sophisticated but also capable of having children. The humor comes from the unexpected combination of these two qualities and the exaggeration of her being so highbrow that she could give birth to a famous statue while wearing glasses.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of music and comedy. The humor is clever and relies on wordplay, which is often appreciated by this audience. The delivery of the line is also important in determining how well it lands, as the host's tone and timing can enhance or diminish the comedic effect.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, this joke would likely receive a rating of 3 (An audible snort). The combination of wit, wordplay, and exaggeration is likely to elicit a chuckle or snort from viewers.
From the perspective of a comedy writer, this joke would also receive a rating of 3 (An audible snort). While it is a clever play on words, it may not be considered a standout joke that would have comedy writers rolling on the floor with laughter. However, it is still an effective and amusing joke.

# Lauren Laverne's intro
**Intended Humor**
The humor in Lauren Laverne's intro comes from the contrast between her role as the presenter of the Culture Show and the suggestion that she is also a mother. The line "What's she going to do next, give birth to the Venus de Milo whilst wearing glasses?" implies that Laverne's accomplishments as a mother are on par with giving birth to a famous statue while wearing glasses. The joke plays on the idea that motherhood is an impressive feat and exaggerates it to an absurd level.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's audience, as it combines humor with a relatable topic (motherhood) and exaggeration. The delivery and timing of the joke will also play a significant role in how well it lands, as the host's tone and comedic timing can enhance or diminish the comedic effect.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, this joke would likely receive a rating of 4 (LOL). The combination of relatable humor, exaggeration, and unexpected imagery (giving birth to the Venus de Milo while wearing glasses) is likely to elicit a strong laugh from viewers.
From the perspective of a comedy writer, this joke would also receive a rating of 4 (LOL). The clever wordplay and exaggeration combined with relatable humor make it a solid joke that would be appreciated by comedy writers.

# Reverend Jon McClure's intro
**Intended Humor**
The humor in Reverend Jon McClure's intro comes from the play on words between "Maker" and "Reverend." The line "While some pop shows will content themselves with just any old 'Maker,' we've only gone and got the actual 'Reverend'!" suggests that other shows settle for less significant guests, while Never Mind the Buzzcocks has managed to secure a guest who is not only a "Maker" but also a "Reverend." The joke relies on the unexpected contrast between the two titles and the exaggeration of Reverend Jon McClure's importance.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's audience, as it combines clever wordplay with humor and exaggeration. The delivery and timing of the joke will also play a significant role in how well it lands, as the host's tone and comedic timing can enhance or diminish the comedic effect.

While it is a clever play on words, it may not be considered a standout joke that would have comedy writers rolling on the floor with laughter. However, it is still an effective and amusing joke.

# Jeremy Edwards' intro
**Intended Humor**
The humor in Jeremy Edwards' intro comes from the use of the term "hunk" to describe him. The line "It's the Incredible Hunk, Jeremy Edwards!" plays on the similarity between the words "hunk" and "Hulk" to create a pun. The joke suggests that Jeremy Edwards is not only attractive but also possesses superhuman strength like the Marvel character Hulk. The humor comes from the unexpected combination of these two qualities and the exaggeration of his attractiveness.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's audience, as it combines humor with a play on words and exaggeration. The delivery and timing of the joke will also play a significant role in how well it lands, as the host's tone and comedic timing can enhance or diminish the comedic effect.

**Funniness Ratings**

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is lead singer with the chart-topping Hoosiers. You may know them from their in no way annoying TV advert which certainly didn't make me want to drill into my own brain and suck out the memories. It's Irwin Sparkes!
Bill's second guest is from critically acclaimed comedies such as Nighty Night, I'm Alan Partridge and who could forget BBC2's Hyperdrive. Nope? 9ish? Thursdays at that woman... Okay, it's Kevin Eldon ladies and gentlemen!
On Phil's team is the visionary, left-field, avant-garde, genre-defying, classically trained singer-songwriter, and he recently called Mika a twat. It's Patrick Wolf!
His second guest is the shining light of Channel 4's popular youth strand T4. She's charmed everyone from Robert De Niro to 50 Cent and she recently called Mika a *bleep* riddled *bleep* basket of a *bleep*! It's my good friend and colleague, Miquita Oliver.

**Intended Humour**

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Ryan Jarman's intro
**Intended Humor**
- The humor in this introduction comes from the irony and exaggeration employed in comparing Ryan Jarman's coolness to other musicians. By stating that he is "number four on the NME Cool List," the introduction suggests that he is cooler than other musicians like Craig Finn, Eddie Argos, and Yannis Philippakis. This exaggeration is meant to be humorous because the concept of ranking musicians based on their coolness is inherently subjective and arbitrary.

**How it Lands**
- This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of music enthusiasts familiar with the concept of "coolness" in the music industry. The exaggeration and irony used in the introduction are also in line with the show's comedic style, which often relies on witty and sarcastic remarks.

# Jermaine Jackson's intro
**Intended Humor**
- The humor in this introduction comes from the play on words and the reference to Jermaine Jackson's brother, Randy Jackson. By stating that "his brother might be Randy but he’s definitely called Jermaine," the introduction creates a pun based on the word "randy," which can mean sexually excited. The joke plays on the audience's expectation of a different meaning for "randy" and subverts it with the introduction of Jermaine Jackson.

**How it Lands**
- This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which is familiar with the Jackson family and their music. The play on words and the pun in the introduction add an element of surprise and humor to the introduction.

This introduction doesn't contain a joke. It is purely informational, introducing Joel Pott as the lead singer from Athlete, a band similar in style to Snow Patrol.

**How it Lands**
As an informational introduction, it is straightforward and provides the necessary details about Joel Pott's background. It may not elicit laughter, but it serves its purpose in introducing the contestant.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: N/A (since it's not a joke)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: N/A (since it's not a joke)

# Kimberley Stewart's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in this introduction plays on the idea that Kimberley Stewart is primarily known as Rod Stewart's daughter and is only famous because of her association with him and Paris Hilton. The humor relies on the contrasting expectations between being Rod Stewart's daughter and having her own accomplishments.

**How it Lands**
The joke works well for the show's typical audience, who are familiar with celebrity culture and the idea of people becoming famous due to their family connections. It may elicit laughs from the audience, especially if they recognize the irony in Kimberley Stewart's introduction.

From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3. An audible snort

# Lethal Bizzle's intro
**Intended Humour**
The humor in this introduction stems from the repetition of the phrase "Oi! Who's that boy? Lethal Bizzle!" The repetition creates a comedic rhythm and builds anticipation for the reveal. The joke works by playfully mocking Lethal Bizzle's name and creating a catchy and memorable introduction.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with Lethal Bizzle and his music. The repetition and energetic delivery by the host add to the comedic effect, making it a memorable introduction for the contestant.

From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4. LOL
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4. LOL

# Jessica Hynes (formerly Jessica Stevenson)'s intro
**Intended Humour**
The humor in this introduction lies in the play on Jessica Hynes' name change. By referring to her as "the comedy actress formerly known as Jessica Stevenson" and mentioning her recent marriage, the joke plays on the idea of celebrities changing their names after marriage and wanting to be known by their new identity. The humor comes from the unexpected twist in the introduction and the allusion to famous name changes.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with celebrity name changes and the concept of reinventing oneself. The introduction cleverly incorporates this idea, making it a humorous and memorable way to introduce Jessica Hynes.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 20 Episode 03: Preston, Anne Charleston, Ed Byrne, Fyfe Dangerfield, and a special guest

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Preston, Bill's first guest is Ordinary Boy and professional celebrity. Preston appeared on "Celebrity Big Brother" and then married the winner, Chantelle. Preston was worried it would alienate hardcore Ordinary Boys fans, but luckily, neither of them were in the country, or existed. Ed Byrne, Bill's second guest, is the voice of the Carphone Warehouse and one of those Irish-style comedians. Ed appeared on "Blind Date" before becoming a comedian. Going on a game show to get on TV and find a wife, imagine the desperation, Preston.  And for Phil's team, GUILLEMOTS lead singer and a lovely man, Fyfe Dangerfield. GUILLEMOTS often start their show by running through the audience, screaming and banging biscuit tins, which is nearly as annoying an opening as hearing the words, "Hello, I'm Katie Melua." Finally, here she is, Bill's second guest. It's only Anne Maddock from Neighbours' Charlene. In 2005, Anne had cosmetic surgery on her neck on the Vanessa Feltz show, "Cosmetic Surgery Live." People with scalpels in the same room as Vanessa, and they slit *your* neck?

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Preston's intro
** Intended Humour **
- The joke here is that Preston, as a member of the band Ordinary Boys, married the winner of "Celebrity Big Brother" (Chantelle), but the joke is that neither of them were in the country or existed. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation, as it is unlikely for someone to marry a winner who doesn't exist.
- Another joke is made about Ed Byrne, referring to him as one of those "Irish-style comedians." This plays on the stereotype that Irish comedians have a particular style or approach to comedy.
- The final joke in Preston's intro is a dig at Preston himself, implying that going on a game show to find a wife (as he did on "Celebrity Big Brother") is desperate.

** How it Lands ** 
- The humor in Preston's intro may land well with the show's typical audience, who are likely fans of comedy and familiar with the premise of the show.
- The jokes rely on wordplay, absurdity, and cultural references, which may resonate with the audience and elicit laughter.

** Funniness Ratings **

** Why it's not a joke **
- Fyfe Dangerfield's intro is purely informational, providing details about his role in the band and their performance style.

# Anne Maddock's intro
** Intended Humour **
- The joke in Anne Maddock's intro is about her appearance on the show "Cosmetic Surgery Live" where she had cosmetic surgery on her neck. The humor comes from the absurdity of having scalpels in the same room as Vanessa Feltz and the implication that it is risky or dangerous.

Contestant: Preston
Judge Analysis: Model misses the core humor of the 'two fans' joke, interpreting it as general absurdity rather than the specific insult about having no fans. It also incorrectly identifies additional jokes that aren't there (about Irish comedians). The model's theory of mind is superficial, offering generic statements about 'fans of comedy.' Depth of analysis is poor, missing the playground insult structure identified in the gold response. Funniness ratings are close to gold standard but seem coincidental given the misunderstanding.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 20 Episode 02: Noel Fielding, Donny Tourette, Philip Olivier, Alfie Jackson

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is Mighty Boosh comedy man and lovely-haired cool dude, Noel Fielding. Noel hates traditional jokes, which is a shame because I was talking to an Englishman, Irishman, and Scotsman the other day, and something particularly funny happened, but you'll never find out, Fielding. His second guest is the Holloways' hip indie frontman, Alfie Jackson. Like the Libertines, the Holloways have two frontmen, but unlike Carl and Pete, Alfie and Rob don't have a highly charged erotic frisson on stage. They just have wonderful sex. 

Phil's first guest is tower of London punk frontman and reality punk TV star, Donny Tourette. Poignantly echoing punk legend Sid Vicious's untimely death from a heroin overdose, Donny Tourette once got thrown off a London bus after refusing to buy a ticket. And to think, the Sex Pistols only sang about anarchy in the UK. This guy's living it, man! Phil's second guest is Hollyoaks in the City star and winner of The Games, Sir Philip Olivier. Philip is known for his toned torso and beefcake physique, but just because he's a big, muscly guy doesn't mean he can't act. That's pure coincidence.

** Intended Humor **
This introduction contains a joke. The humor lies in the contrast between Noel Fielding's dislike for traditional jokes and the setup for a traditional joke that the host, Bill, presents. The joke is that Bill teases the audience with the promise of a funny incident involving an Englishman, Irishman, and Scotsman but then immediately denies the punchline, stating that Noel Fielding will never find out. This plays on the expectation of a joke and subverts it by deliberately withholding the punchline.

** How it Lands ** 
This joke is likely to land well with the audience of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, as it is a show that often relies on subverting expectations and playing with comedic conventions. The humor in this joke relies on the audience's familiarity with traditional joke setups and the anticipation of a punchline.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 20 Episode 01: Alan Davies, Chris Peck, Matt Baker, Nerina Pallot

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest would be the leading comedian of his generation, if it wasn't for that ridiculous hair, it's Alan Davies.  Men want to have a drink with him, women want to sleep with him, and people who've got their mortgages from the Abbey want to punch him in his trustworthy face.

His second guest is Boy Kill Boy frontman, Chris Peck. Last year, when Ibiza, Boy Kill Boy went crazy in their rented mansion, smashing crockery, breaking windows and damaging a bathroom cabinet, causing a massive £10,000 worth of PR credibility.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Alan Davies's intro
**Intended Humor**
- The joke in this introduction revolves around Alan Davies's hair. The humor here comes from the contrast between his status as a leading comedian and the ridiculousness of his hair. The joke implies that his hair is so outrageous that it prevents him from being considered the leading comedian of his generation.
- The second part of the joke plays on the idea that Alan Davies is attractive to both men and women, but people who have mortgages from the Abbey (a reference to a financial institution) want to punch him in his "trustworthy" face. The humor here comes from the irony that someone who is seen as trustworthy by some would be seen as deserving of a punch by others.

**How it Lands**
- For the show's typical audience, who are fans of comedy and familiar with Alan Davies, this joke is likely to land well. They would be familiar with Alan Davies's appearance and reputation as a comedian, which adds to the humor.
- In terms of funniness, this joke is likely to elicit an audible snort or even a laugh from the audience watching at home. The humor is cleverly crafted and relies on irony and exaggeration, which are elements that often resonate with comedic sensibilities.

**Funniness Ratings**
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort

# Chris Peck's intro
**Intended Humor**
- The joke in this introduction revolves around the band Boy Kill Boy's behavior during their time in Ibiza.

The mention of causing £10,000 worth of PR credibility damage adds to the absurdity of the situation.

Judge Analysis: The model missed key elements of both jokes. For the hair joke, it failed to grasp that the 'ridiculous hair' was an absurd scapegoat implying lack of merit. For the Abbey joke, it only superficially understood the 'trustworthy/punch' contrast without capturing the deeper commentary on selling out to banks. The model's theory of mind was basic, lacking insight into why these jokes would particularly resonate with the audience. The depth of analysis was shallow, mostly restating the obvious without unpacking the clever construction. Funniness ratings were close to gold standard for audience but missed the mark on comedy writer perspective.

Judge Analysis: The model completely missed the key punchline structure of the PR credibility joke - it thought the humor was just about exaggerated rock star behavior rather than the brilliant misdirection and reveal that it was all for PR. This fundamental misunderstanding led to poor theory of mind insights and shallow analysis. The model didn't recognize the careful setup and timing that made the joke effective. Funniness ratings were notably lower than the gold standard, reflecting this lack of understanding.

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is modern pop star and MySpace hussy, Lily Allen. Lily was expelled from five schools. At 14, she ran away to go to Glastonbury and she pushed pills in Ibiza. 

His second guest is 80s pop star and party man, Steve Strange. Steve took part in Celebrity Scissorhands for Children In Need. It was an unusual reality show in that it had no winner, but nine losers.

Bill's first guest is saucy pop minx and fertile mother of two, Jamelia. In 2004, Jamelia wore a £400,000 diamond-encrusted dress to the MOBOs. She almost looked three-quarters of a million dollars.

His second guest is Welsh comedian, Mark Watson. Mark pretends to be Welsh in his act, but he's actually from Bristol.

# Phil's first guest is modern pop star and MySpace hussy, Lily Allen. Lily was expelled from five schools. At 14, she ran away to go to Glastonbury and she pushed pills in Ibiza.

** Intended Humour **
The joke in this introduction revolves around the contrasting image of a modern pop star and the derogatory term "MySpace hussy" used to describe Lily Allen. The humor is derived from the unexpected and exaggerated description of Lily Allen as a "hussy," which is a derogatory term for a promiscuous woman. The joke continues by highlighting Lily's rebellious behavior, being expelled from five schools and running away to go to Glastonbury at the age of 14. The mention of "pushing pills in Ibiza" further adds to the humorous image of Lily Allen as a wild and rebellious character.

** How it Lands **
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of comedy and music. The humor is based on exaggeration and the unexpected description of Lily Allen, which can be amusing to the audience.

# Bill's first guest is the funky regional McFly hunk, Danny Jones!

** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains a joke. The humor comes from the play on words and the exaggeration used to describe Danny Jones. The phrase "funky regional McFly hunk" is a clever combination of descriptors that create a humorous image in the audience's mind. "Funky" suggests that Danny Jones is cool and stylish, while "regional" adds a touch of self-awareness, acknowledging that McFly may not be as globally famous as some other bands. "McFly hunk" adds the element of attractiveness and youthfulness to the description. The joke works by using these descriptors in a way that is unexpected and slightly absurd.

** How it Lands **
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which is made up of fans of British comedy and music. The humor relies on the audience's familiarity with the band McFly and their image as young heartthrobs. The exaggeration and play on words are likely to generate laughter and amusement from the audience.

The phrase "Feeling frontman and all-round respectable booking" is a clever combination of descriptors that create a humorous image in the audience's mind. "Feeling frontman" refers to Dan Gillespie Sells' role in the band The Feeling, while "all-round respectable booking" adds a touch of self-awareness, acknowledging that the guest is a well-respected and appropriate choice for the show.

** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains a joke. The humor here comes from the play on words and the exaggeration used to describe Jenni Falconer. The phrase "GMTV's celebrity honey-trap" is a clever way to describe Jenni Falconer as an attractive and alluring television personality. The phrase "Scotland's answer to Lorraine Kelly" adds a touch of comparison and humor, suggesting that Jenni Falconer is a Scottish equivalent to the well-known TV presenter Lorraine Kelly. The joke works by using these descriptors in a way that is unexpected and slightly absurd.

** How it Lands **
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which is made up of fans of British comedy and music.

** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains a joke. The humor here comes from the play on words and the exaggeration used to describe David Gest. The phrase "saucy funny-haired jungle stunner" is a clever combination of descriptors that create a humorous image in the audience's mind. "Saucy" suggests that David Gest is flirtatious and provocative, while "funny-haired" adds an element of eccentricity and uniqueness to the description. The phrase "jungle stunner" refers to David Gest's appearance on the reality show "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!" where contestants face challenges in a jungle setting. The addition of "David-reassuringly-expensive-Gest" adds an extra layer of humor by playing on the guest's reputation for being extravagant and high-maintenance. The joke works by using these descriptors in a way that is unexpected and slightly absurd.

** How it Lands **
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which is made up of fans of British comedy and music.

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
- Phil's first guest, it's Matt Priest of Dodgy. Matt's such a legendary ligger that he was once unable to appear on this show, because he'd already accepted an invitation to the launch of the PG Tips triangular bag.
- Phil's other guest is Tom Robinson, one of the finest pop writers to come out of punk. One of Tom's early hits was "Glad to Be Gay." 
- Sean's first guest, Lauren Laverne, singer with Sunderland's indie All Saints, Kenickie.
- Sean's other guest is Jeff Green, of TV and stand-up comedy fame. Jeff's been described in the press as a cheeky cherub, at least that's what he told the police when he was arrested on Hampstead Heath stark naked and holding a bow and arrow.

# Phil's first guest, it's Matt Priest of Dodgy. Matt's such a legendary ligger that he was once unable to appear on this show, because he'd already accepted an invitation to the launch of the PG Tips triangular bag.

** Intended Humour **

The joke in this introduction is that Matt Priest is described as a "legendary ligger" which is a term used to describe someone who attends events or parties as a guest without contributing anything. The punchline is that Matt was unable to appear on the show because he had already accepted an invitation to the launch of the PG Tips triangular bag. The humor lies in the absurdity of the reason for his absence, as the launch of a triangular tea bag is not a significant event and would not normally be a reason to miss a television appearance.

** How it Lands **

This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the concept of a "ligger" and may appreciate the absurdity of missing a TV appearance for such a trivial reason. The humor is also enhanced by the specific reference to the PG Tips triangular bag, which adds an extra layer of absurdity to the joke.

# Phil's other guest is Tom Robinson, one of the finest pop writers to come out of punk. One of Tom's early hits was "Glad to Be Gay."

** Intended Humour **

The joke in this introduction is a play on words. Tom Robinson is described as one of the finest pop writers to come out of punk, which is a literal description of his background in the music genre. However, the punchline is that one of Tom's early hits was "Glad to Be Gay," which plays on the phrase "coming out" as a euphemism for revealing one's homosexuality. The humor lies in the unexpected contrast between the literal interpretation of the phrase and its actual meaning.

** How it Lands **

This joke may land well with the show's typical audience, who are likely to appreciate wordplay and clever use of language. The humor is also enhanced by the fact that the topic of homosexuality is often considered taboo or controversial, making the joke more subversive and unexpected. However, the joke's effectiveness may depend on the audience's familiarity with Tom Robinson and his music.

# Sean's first guest, Lauren Laverne, singer with Sunderland's indie All Saints, Kenickie.

This introduction does not contain a joke. It is purely informational, providing the audience with the name and background of the guest, Lauren Laverne. There are no comedic elements present in this introduction.

** Why it's not a joke **

The introduction is purely factual, providing information about Lauren Laverne's background as a singer with the indie bands All Saints and Kenickie. There is no attempt at humor or any comedic elements present in this introduction.

# Sean's other guest is Jeff Green, of TV and stand-up comedy fame. Jeff's been described in the press as a cheeky cherub, at least that's what he told the police when he was arrested on Hampstead Heath stark naked and holding a bow and arrow.

** Intended Humour **

The humor in this introduction comes from the unexpected and absurd description of Jeff Green as a "cheeky cherub" and the bizarre situation he supposedly found himself in. The punchline is that Jeff told the police that he was a "cheeky cherub" when he was arrested on Hampstead Heath while being naked and holding a bow and arrow. The humor lies in the contrast between the innocent and angelic image of a cherub and the outrageous and inappropriate behavior described in the punchline.

This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who appreciate dark and subversive humor. The humor is enhanced by the specific details of the situation, such as being arrested on Hampstead Heath while naked and holding a bow and arrow.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 01: Anthea Turner, Alesha Dixon, Phil Nicol, Ricky Ross

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is former Misteeq star, now a solo artist and FHM's 98th sexiest woman of 2002, it's Alesha. Alesha's mum is a hairdresser and used to run the Misteeq fan club, giving her just 22 hours a day for hairdressing and two hours for lunch. His second guest is surely not Blue Peter, GMTV, Lottery and Wish You Were Here legend, Anthea Turner. Yes it is, it's Anthea Turner. Anthea has made a TV comeback with her BBC3 series, The Perfect Housewife. So now we can say Anthea Turner's washed up. In the nicer, slightly less accurate way. Bill's first guest is the front man of stadium filling Scottish rockers, Deacon Blue, it's Ricky Ross. Lorraine from Deacon Blue has a recurring nightmare where the band are playing to a baying crowd without the correct instruments. I have a recurring nightmare that I'm stuck in the middle of a baying crowd watching Deacon Blue. Only joking, I've never heard of you. Bill's second guest is the winner of this year's Edinburgh Festival Comedy Award, it's funny man, Phil Nichol. Phil plays the producer on a fictional TV panel show whose main joke is they can't get any decent guests. Oh the irony.

# Test Model Analysis

# Alesha's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction revolves around Alesha's mother being a hairdresser and running the Misteeq fan club. The humor lies in the exaggeration that her mother spends almost all her time on hairdressing, leaving only two hours for lunch. The joke plays with the stereotype of hairdressers being overly committed to their profession.

**How it Lands**
- This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on a familiar stereotype and exaggeration. It is a light-hearted and harmless joke that is unlikely to offend or confuse the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
- For the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)

# Anthea Turner's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction revolves around Anthea Turner's TV comeback with her series "The Perfect Housewife." The humor lies in the pun of saying she is "washed up" in a nice and slightly less accurate way. This is a play on words, as "washed up" typically means someone is no longer successful or relevant, but in this case, it refers to her new show about housekeeping.

**How it Lands**
- This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on wordplay and a slight twist on a common phrase. It is a light-hearted and clever joke that is easy to understand and appreciate.

**Funniness Ratings**
- For the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Ricky Ross's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction revolves around Ricky Ross being the frontman of Deacon Blue, a Scottish rock band. The humor lies in the contrast between Lorraine from Deacon Blue's recurring nightmare of the band playing without the correct instruments and the host's recurring nightmare of being stuck in a baying crowd watching Deacon Blue. The host then adds a self-deprecating twist by saying he's never heard of Ricky Ross, implying that the nightmare of watching Deacon Blue is not based on their actual music, but rather on his lack of interest in the band.

**How it Lands**
- This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it combines self-deprecation with a humorous twist on the band's reputation. It plays with the idea that Deacon Blue may not be well-known or liked by everyone, but still maintains a playful tone.

**Funniness Ratings**
- For the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Phil Nichol's intro
**Intended Humour**
- The joke in this introduction revolves around Phil Nichol playing the producer on a fictional TV panel show where they can't get any decent guests. The humor lies in the irony that Phil Nichol, who is being introduced as a guest, is also the winner of the Edinburgh Festival Comedy Award. The joke plays with the expectation that the guests on a panel show should be well-known and respected, but in this case, the joke is that the producer can't seem to book anyone good, except for Phil Nichol.

**How it Lands**
- This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on irony and a twist on the expectations of a panel show. It is a clever and self-aware joke that showcases Phil Nichol's comedic talent.

**Funniness Ratings**
- For the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

Overall, the contestant introductions in this segment contain jokes that are likely to land well with the show's typical audience. They are light-hearted, clever, and rely on familiar tropes and wordplay. The funniness ratings indicate that these jokes are generally funny, eliciting laughter and amusement from both the audience watching at home and a comedy writer.

Judge Analysis: While the model captured the basic structure, it missed the key element of 'unnecessary escalation of hostility' identified in the gold response. The analysis focuses too much on explaining the setup rather than analyzing what makes it funny. The interpretation of the 'never heard of you' line as self-deprecating is incorrect - it's actually an aggressive dismissal.

Judge Analysis: The model's analysis is overly complicated and misses the simple elegance of the joke identified in the gold response.

However, its funniness ratings align well with the gold standard.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 05: John Barrowman, Kelli Young, Daniel Bedingfield, Robin Ince

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is the star of sci-fi hit drama Torchwood and practicing homosexual, John Barrowman. His second guest is Liberty X songstress, Kelli Young. Kelli's last single stormed into the top 48.

Phill's first guest is pop star and tormented genius, Daniel Bedingfield. Phill's second guest is music loving comedian, writer and broadcaster, Robin Ince.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# John Barrowman's intro
**Intended Humor**
The humor in this introduction comes from the play on words and the unexpected contrast between John Barrowman's profession and his sexual orientation. The phrase "practicing homosexual" is a clever twist on the commonly used phrase "practicing Catholic" or "practicing lawyer," implying that being homosexual is a profession or skill that one can practice. This unexpected association between a person's sexual orientation and a professional or skill adds an element of surprise and humor to the introduction.

**How it Lands**
Considering the audience of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which is known for its irreverent and often controversial humor, this joke is likely to land well. The show's typical audience is accustomed to edgy and boundary-pushing comedy, making them more likely to appreciate the humor in this introduction. Additionally, the show often plays with stereotypes and societal norms, so this joke fits well within that context.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

# Kelli Young's intro
**Intended Humor**
The humor in this introduction comes from the exaggeration and irony in describing Kelli Young's last single as "storming into the top 48." The phrase "storming into the top" is typically used to describe songs that reach the top of the charts or achieve great success. By stating that her last single only reached the top 48, it emphasizes the lack of success and exaggerates the underwhelming achievement, creating a humorous contrast.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are fans of music and pop culture, this joke is likely to land well. The audience will likely understand the context of music charts and the irony behind the exaggerated description. However, the humor may be more appreciated by viewers who are familiar with the specific music industry and the significance of chart rankings.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Daniel Bedingfield's intro
**Not a Joke**
This introduction does not contain a joke. It provides information about Daniel Bedingfield's profession as a pop star and describes him as a tormented genius. The mention of his profession and personality traits is purely informative and does not aim to create humor.

**Why it's not a joke**
The introduction simply states facts about Daniel Bedingfield and does not incorporate any comedic elements. The mention of him being a "tormented genius" may be seen as a play on the stereotype of tortured artists, but it lacks the exaggeration or unexpected twist that characterizes a joke.

# Robin Ince's intro
**Not a Joke**
This introduction does not contain a joke. It provides information about Robin Ince's profession as a music-loving comedian, writer, and broadcaster. The mention of his profession and interests is purely informative and does not aim to create humor.

**Why it's not a joke**
Similar to the previous introduction, this introduction simply states facts about Robin Ince and does not incorporate any comedic elements. The mention of him being a music-loving comedian adds some characterization, but it does not contain any humorous elements or punchlines.

Judge Analysis: The model completely missed the key humor element - the deliberately dated, pearl-clutching phrasing.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 02: Will Smith, Paul Young, Matt Willis, Vanessa Feltz

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil’s first guest is the TV presenter of the moment, Vanessa Feltz. 
In 2004, Vanessa hosted Cosmetic Surgery Live on Channel 5, which is the only show to feature live anal bleaching – unless we have a draw tonight and have to go to a tiebreak.
Phil’s second guest is former Busted star, now solo star, certain to make it, it’s Matt Willis.
Last year, Matt Willis checked into the Priory to treat his alcohol problem. After two weeks in therapy, he finally found the emotional strength to stand up and say, 'My name is Matt Willis, and I have an album out.' 

Bill’s first guest is an 80s star who's still very famous and relevant today, it’s Paul Young.
Paul has refused to write songs for Britney Spears, because he said she lacked credibility – as he walked off the set of Celebrity MasterChef after his cook-off with Timmy Mallett.
Bill’s second guest is hugely well-known funny comedian, Will Smith.
Okay, we don’t make a lot of mistakes on this show, but we’ve clearly booked the wrong Will Smith. Even worse than that, we’ve booked THE right Vanessa Feltz.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 05: Rick Witter, Mark Owen, Richard Morton, Shovell

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight is Rick Witter, lead singer from Yorkshire's top indie combo, Shed Seven. Shed Seven were recently told they are absolutely huge in Thailand, but then I bet the bar girls say that to all the customers.

Phil's second guest is Shovell, top thumper with megastars M-People. Shovell used to be a builder, which caused problems at the band's early gigs; he kept sitting on the lighting rig above Heather Small shouting, "Hello darling, wanna go on me bongos?" 

Sean's first guest is Mark Owen, ex of Take That and pop's cuddliest boy next door. Take That once agreed to do a national tour on behalf of the Family Planning Association, to promote safe sex, but they pulled out at the last minute.

Sean's other guest is Richard Morton, stand-up comedy's only guitar-toting Geordie. He's been described as the most effeminate man in Newcastle; in the recent freezing weather, he was spotted on a street corner wearing a long-sleeved t-shirt.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Rick Witter's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Rick Witter's introduction revolves around the idea that Shed Seven, his indie band, was told they are popular in Thailand, but this is dismissed as something the bar girls say to all the customers. The humor comes from the ironic contrast between the idea of being "absolutely huge" and the suggestion that it's just a standard line used by bar girls. It plays on the stereotype of bar girls exaggerating their interest in customers to make them feel special.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of British comedy who are familiar with the self-deprecating humor often found in British comedy shows. The humor in this joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the stereotype of bar girls in Thailand and their interactions with customers. 

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, this joke would likely elicit an audible snort (3) as it is a clever play on expectations and relies on the audience's understanding of the stereotype. From the perspective of a comedy writer, this joke would also receive a rating of an audible snort (3) as it effectively combines irony and stereotype humor to create a humorous contrast.

# Shovell's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Shovell's introduction revolves around his previous profession as a builder and how it caused problems during M-People's early gigs. The humor comes from the absurd image of Shovell sitting on the lighting rig above Heather Small, the lead singer of M-People, and propositioning her with a suggestive invitation to play his bongos. The play on words between "bongos" and a slang term for breasts adds a layer of innuendo to the joke.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which enjoys playful innuendo and absurd situations. The humor relies on the unexpectedness of a builder sitting on a lighting rig and making suggestive comments to the lead singer of a band during a performance.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, this joke would likely elicit an audible snort (3) as it relies on a combination of visual imagery and innuendo to create a humorous situation. From the perspective of a comedy writer, this joke would receive a rating of LOL (4) as it effectively combines absurdity, wordplay, and innuendo to create a humorous scenario.

# Mark Owen's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Mark Owen's introduction plays on the contrast between his image as the "cuddliest boy next door" and his involvement in a national tour promoting safe sex for the Family Planning Association. The humor comes from the irony of a pop star associated with innocence and romantic appeal being involved in promoting safe sex, as it subverts the audience's expectations of his image.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which appreciates ironic and subversive humor. The humor in this joke relies on the audience's familiarity with Mark Owen's image as a member of Take That and their understanding of the contrast between that image and promoting safe sex.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, this joke would likely elicit a minor exhale out the nose (2) as it relies on a subtle subversion of expectations. From the perspective of a comedy writer, this joke would receive a rating of an audible snort (3) as it effectively combines irony and subversion to create a humorous contrast.

# Richard Morton's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Richard Morton's introduction revolves around his reputation as the most effeminate man in Newcastle. The humor comes from the unexpected twist that despite being effeminate, he was spotted in freezing weather wearing a long-sleeved t-shirt, which is typically associated with masculine attire. The joke plays on the stereotype of effeminacy and subverts it by presenting a contradiction.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which appreciates subversive humor and plays on stereotypes. The humor in this joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the stereotype of effeminacy and their understanding of the contrast between the stereotype and Morton's choice of clothing.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, this joke would likely elicit an audible snort (3) as it relies on a combination of subversion and stereotype humor to create a humorous twist. From the perspective of a comedy writer, this joke would also receive a rating of an audible snort (3) as it effectively combines subversion and stereotype humor to create a humorous contradiction.

In summary, the introductions for the contestants in this episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks all contain jokes. Each joke utilizes different comedic elements such as irony, subversion, wordplay, and stereotype humor. Overall, the jokes are likely to land well with the show's typical audience, and from the perspective of a comedy writer, they range from an audible snort (3) to LOL (4) in terms of funniness ratings.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 07: Mary Ann Hobbs, Justin Currie, Billy Bragg, Jonathan Ross

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Justin Currie, frontman for Del Amitri. Del Amitri have a reputation for being one of rock's most miserable bands. In fact, when they supported The Smiths in 1985, Morrissey used to have to cheer them up with his tickling stick. And it's a warm welcome back for Sean's other guest, the boy balladeer from Barking, Billy Bragg. Billy Bragg was once in the army but lasted for just 90 days, making his the least convincing military career since Colonel Sanders. 

Phil's first guest is Mary Anne Hobbs, rising DJ at Radio 1. Mary Anne's a woman who needs no introduction because, being a Radio 1 DJ, she'd only talk over it anyway. Phil's second guest - oh no, he's back again, it's Jonathan Ross. Jonathan's well known for his love of obscure low-budget trash and incidentally, this is his fourth appearance on the show.

**Intended Humor**
The joke in this introduction revolves around the contrast between Del Amitri's reputation as a miserable band and the idea of Morrissey, known for his own melancholic music, trying to cheer them up with a tickling stick. The humor comes from the absurdity of the mental image created by the combination of these elements.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it plays on the well-known reputations of both Del Amitri and Morrissey.

**Intended Humor**
The joke in this introduction is a play on the idea of Billy Bragg being a "boy balladeer" and his short-lived military career. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of his soft-spoken, balladeer persona with the image of someone in the military. The comparison to Colonel Sanders, known for his fried chicken empire rather than his military prowess, adds an element of absurdity to the joke.

The joke plays on the expectation that a DJ would introduce themselves, but in this case, it is turned on its head.

**How it Lands**

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 04: Zoë Ball, Louis Eliot, Graham Norton, Keith Duffy

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil’s team, it’s Louie Eliot, singer with top 20 hipsters and media darlings Rialto. According to Rialto, whenever they want to say something dim they break into a Liam Gallagher impression. Whenever Liam Gallagher wants to say something dim, he just opens his mouth.

Phil’s second guest is Zoe Ball. Zoe joined the Big Breakfast after Chris Evans left. On her first day, she broke an expensive prop intended for a stupid stunt, but he'd left the week before. 

Sean’s first guest is Boyzone’s Keith Duffy. While on tour in Japan, the boy's had voodoo dolls left in their hotel rooms with broken glass in them and the message "You Will Die", P.S. can I have an autograph for my sister?

Sean’s other guest is comedian and television presenter Graham Norton. Amazingly Graham won an award for being the best presenter on the Jack Docherty Show - narrowly beating  Jack Docherty. He's already tipped to win the award for best captain of Sean's team.

# Test Model Analysis

# Louie Eliot's intro
**Intended Humor**
The joke in Louie Eliot's intro revolves around the contrast between Rialto's use of a Liam Gallagher impression and Liam Gallagher's actual speech. The humor lies in the irony that whenever Rialto wants to sound dim, they imitate Liam Gallagher, but in reality, when Liam Gallagher wants to sound dim, he doesn't need to imitate anyone because he naturally speaks that way.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which is familiar with the music industry and pop culture references. The humor relies on the audience recognizing the contrast between Rialto's imitation and Liam Gallagher's actual behavior, and finding it amusing.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, this joke can be rated as a solid "An audible snort" (3). It is a clever play on words that requires some background knowledge to fully appreciate.

From the perspective of a comedy writer, this joke can be rated as a "LOL" (4). The irony and wordplay are well-crafted and create a humorous contrast.

# Zoe Ball's intro
**Intended Humor**
The joke in Zoe Ball's intro is based on the unexpected twist that she broke an expensive prop on her first day at the Big Breakfast, only to find out later that Chris Evans, the previous host, had already left. The humor lies in the fact that the mistake was pointless and unnecessary because the person responsible for the prop was no longer there.

**How it Lands**
The humor in this joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the Big Breakfast show and the context of Chris Evans leaving. It may resonate more with viewers who were fans of the show and remember the transition between hosts. For the general audience, it may still be amusing, but the impact might be slightly reduced.

**Funniness Ratings**

# Keith Duffy's intro
**Intended Humor**
The joke in Keith Duffy's intro revolves around a humorous incident that happened to Boyzone while on tour in Japan. The humor lies in the absurdity of voodoo dolls being left in their hotel rooms with broken glass and a threatening message, followed by a polite request for an autograph. The contrast between the threatening message and the seemingly innocent autograph request creates the comedic element.

**Intended Humor**
The joke in Graham Norton's intro is based on his achievement of winning the award for being the best presenter on the Jack Docherty Show, narrowly beating Jack Docherty himself. The humor lies in the irony that Graham Norton is already tipped to win the award for the best captain of Sean's team, suggesting that he is consistently besting Jack Docherty.

**How it Lands**

Judge Analysis: The model misses the simplicity of the joke, over-complicating it with unnecessary analysis about 'irony'. The gold standard correctly identifies it as a straightforward mockery of Gallagher. The model's funniness ratings are notably off - rating it higher than the gold standard without justification. The model's theory of mind insight is shallow, lacking understanding of why this kind of basic celebrity mockery works for the show's audience.

Judge Analysis: The model completely misses the clever wordplay identified in the gold standard about 'stunt' being a TV-friendly substitute word. Instead, it invents an entirely different interpretation about the prop being 'pointless' because Evans had left. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the actual joke. The analysis lacks any real insight and the ratings are based on this incorrect interpretation.

Judge Analysis: The model correctly identifies the core contrast between threatening and polite fan behavior, though doesn't analyze it as deeply as the gold standard. The theory of mind analysis is adequate but generic. The funniness ratings are reasonably aligned with the gold standard, though the model hedges by suggesting multiple possible ratings.

Judge Analysis: The model misinterprets the joke, inventing a non-existent ongoing rivalry narrative that isn't present in the original. The gold standard correctly identifies it as a simple absurdist joke about competing on one's own show. The model's ratings are inflated based on this misinterpretation, and its analysis lacks the gold standard's observation about the unnecessary second line.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 03: John Moloney, Toyah Wilcox, Saul Davie, Tom Wright

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team, Yorkshire's own Tony Wright of the top ten metal band, Terrorvision. Terrorvision's gigs have been described as a laugh, joke, and a crate of ale, just like a night out with Chris Evans, only with a laugh and the joke. 

Phil's second guest is Toyah Willcox, pop star, Good Sex Guide presenter, and the voice of the Teletubbies. She spends the day saying things like, let's play with Tinky Winky, eh-oh, and again, and again, and again. And after The Good Sex Guide, she does Teletubbies.

On Sean's team, the first guest is Tim Booth from international student favorites, James. When the band played their biggest hit, Sit Down, the audience would respond by sitting down on the floor, which was fine until the Glastonbury Festival when 500 people drowned in three feet of mud.

Sean's other guest is laconic stand-up, John Moloney. John is a favorite with the critics and was recently described in Time Out as "Man, 30, non-smoker, seeks woman any age for physical relationship."

# Test Model Analysis

# Tony Wright's intro
** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains a joke. The joke is a play on the idea that Tony Wright's gigs with his band Terrorvision are so fun and enjoyable that they can be compared to a night out with Chris Evans, a well-known British television presenter and DJ. The humor comes from the exaggeration and absurdity of comparing a night out with a famous celebrity to a night out at a gig. The joke is further emphasized by the phrase "only with a laugh and the joke," which implies that a night out with Chris Evans might not be as enjoyable or entertaining as a Terrorvision gig.

** How it Lands ** 
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of British comedy and music. The humor relies on the audience's familiarity with Chris Evans and the idea of a fun night out, as well as their appreciation for witty and exaggerated comparisons. Overall, the joke is likely to be well-received and generate laughter from the audience.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Toyah Willcox's intro
** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains a joke. The joke plays on Toyah Willcox's role as the voice of the Teletubbies, a popular children's television show. The humor comes from the contrast between her innocent and child-friendly role on the show and her previous job as a presenter for The Good Sex Guide. The joke suggests that after working on a show about sex, she goes on to do a show for children, which creates an ironic and unexpected connection between the two. The repetition of phrases like "let's play with Tinky Winky, eh-oh, and again, and again, and again" adds to the humor by exaggerating her involvement with the Teletubbies.

** How it Lands ** 
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which appreciates clever and unexpected connections. The humor relies on the audience's familiarity with Toyah Willcox's roles on both The Good Sex Guide and the Teletubbies.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Tim Booth's intro
** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains a joke. The joke plays on the idea that the band James is so popular among international students that their biggest hit, "Sit Down," would make the audience sit down on the floor during their performances. The humor comes from the exaggeration of the audience's response and the unexpected consequence of people drowning in mud at the Glastonbury Festival. The joke creates a humorous contrast between the band's seemingly harmless music and the unintentional danger it caused. 

** How it Lands ** 
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on their familiarity with music festivals and the concept of a crowd sitting down during a performance. The humor comes from the unexpected and absurd outcome of people drowning in mud, which creates a sense of surprise and amusement. Overall, the joke is likely to be well-received and considered funny.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# John Moloney's intro
** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains a joke. The joke is a play on a personal ad or dating profile that describes John Moloney as a non-smoking man in his thirties seeking a woman for a physical relationship. The humor comes from the absurdity and self-deprecating nature of the description, as it reduces John Moloney to a simple and impersonal advertisement. The joke also plays on the contrast between the personal and intimate nature of a physical relationship and the impersonal format of a personal ad.

** How it Lands ** 
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on their familiarity with personal ads and the humor derived from their often impersonal and exaggerated descriptions. The self-deprecating nature of the joke adds to its humor, as it highlights the absurdity of reducing a person to a few lines in a personal ad. Overall, the joke is likely to be well-received and considered funny.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Intro Text

Phil's first guest is Rick McMurray from chart-toppers Ash. The band wrote their number one album while still at school. They also wrote a brilliant follow-up but claimed the dog ate it.

Phil's second guest is Lemmy, the main man with heavy metal mothers Motorhead. Lemmy's very proud that his band has been going ten years longer than the Third Reich, and funnily enough, they've also done more damage to Coventry. 

Sean's first guest is Mani, bassist with the mighty Primal Scream. Mani's previous band, the Stone Roses, went on a drunken rampage in their record company's offices, which cost tens of thousands of pounds. They rang accountants who commissioned another Chesney Hawkes album.

Sean's other guest, yes he's young, gifted and back, Richard Fairbrass. Richard says, "Although I'm predominantly gay, I reserve the right to wake up with a big pair of tits," which is no way to talk about the other members of Right Said Fred.

**Intended Humor**
This introduction contains a joke. The humor comes from the comparison between Teenage Fanclub and The Beatles and the punchline that three members of Teenage Fanclub are delighted while the drummer is suing for slander.

The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of music and comedy. The comparison to The Beatles is a recognizable cultural reference that many viewers would understand. The punchline adds an element of surprise and subverts expectations, which can enhance the humor for the audience.

This introduction contains a joke. The humor comes from the exaggeration of Jamie Redknapp's romantic gestures, specifically taking Louise to the ground for intimate candlelit dinners.

The humor lies in the unexpected and absurd nature of the romantic gesture.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it combines elements of celebrity culture and absurdity. The exaggeration of Jamie Redknapp's romantic gestures adds a comedic twist and can enhance the humor for the audience.

# Phil's second guest is comedian Jeff Green. Jeff's one of the country's most popular stand-ups and famous for his razor-sharp observation. Only this morning he came up with, "Christ, this razor's sharp."

**Intended Humor**
This introduction contains a joke. The humor comes from the play on words and the subversion of expectations. The phrase "razor-sharp observation" is typically used to describe someone's keen perception or insightful commentary. However, in this case, the punchline reveals that Jeff Green's "razor-sharp observation" is a literal observation about the sharpness of a razor. The humor lies in the unexpected and ironic twist on the phrase.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, as it relies on wordplay and a comedic twist. The subversion of expectations adds an element of surprise and can enhance the humor for the audience.

**Intended Humor**
The joke in this introduction revolves around the band Placebo and their name. The humor comes from the play on words between "placebo" and "blouses." The phrase "top five fit goth blouses" is unexpected and creates a humorous image in the mind of the audience. Additionally, the mention of other bands with medication-related names, such as "Brian Eno's adamant acid" and "Dexy's Midnight Rennies," adds to the comedic effect by creating a pattern and exaggerating the prevalence of medication-themed band names.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of music and comedy. The humor relies on the audience's familiarity with the band Placebo and their association with the goth subculture. Additionally, the mention of other bands with medication-related names may resonate with the audience's knowledge of music history.

**Intended Humor**
The humor in this introduction comes from the play on words and the unexpected twist. The phrase "heavy metal warrior" adds a humorous exaggeration to Bruce Dickinson's persona. The mention of Iron Maiden as "satanic cock rockers" adds to the comedic effect by creating an amusing image in the mind of the audience. The joke reaches its punchline with the phrase "the beast has since gone ex-directory to get rid of him," which plays on the idea that the beast, commonly associated with Iron Maiden, has changed its phone number to avoid Bruce Dickinson.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of music and comedy.

**Intended Humor**
The humor in this introduction comes from the play on words and the unexpected comparison between the band Republica and the show Baywatch. The phrase "top ten techno monkeys" adds a humorous exaggeration to Republica's status. The mention of "Ready To Go" being played on Baywatch creates a humorous contrast between the serious nature of the show and the upbeat nature of the song. The phrase "the only show where both the soundtrack and the cast are available in vinyl" adds to the comedic effect by highlighting the outdated format of vinyl records and emphasizing the uniqueness of Baywatch's soundtrack being available in that format.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of music and comedy. The humor relies on the audience's familiarity with Republica and their hit song "Ready To Go." Additionally, the mention of Baywatch, a popular and well-known show, adds to the comedic effect by creating a surprising connection between the band and the show.

# Sean’s second guest is comedian, author, and chart-topper David Baddiel. David’s got a new video out right now. It’s called Swedish Lesbian Sauna Schoolgirls and it’s due back on Wednesday.

**Intended Humor**
The humor in this introduction comes from the unexpected and somewhat provocative title of David Baddiel's new video. The phrase "Swedish Lesbian Sauna Schoolgirls" creates a humorous image in the mind of the audience and plays on the idea of a sensational and controversial video. The mention of the video being due back on Wednesday adds a humorous twist by implying that it is a popular and in-demand item, despite its potentially controversial content.

**How it Lands**
This joke may land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of comedy and may appreciate the provocative nature of the title. However, the humor in this introduction relies heavily on shock value and may not resonate with all viewers. Some may find the joke offensive or in poor taste. Overall, the success of this joke in landing depends on the individual sensibilities of the audience members.

# Phil's first guest is Richard Fairbrass from Right Said Fred. Richard is a singer and TV presenter who's brought his own weightlifting gym. He's now an expert at the clean and the jerk, but he curiously has no interest in the snatch.

**Intended Humor**
This introduction contains a joke. The humor comes from the double entendre of the phrase "no interest in the snatch." The phrase "snatch" is a colloquial term for a weightlifting move, but it also has a sexual connotation. The joke plays on the ambiguity of the word, implying that Richard is not interested in the weightlifting move, but also making a subtle innuendo about his sexual preferences.

**How it Lands**
The joke would most likely land well with the show's typical audience, which consists of viewers who enjoy British humor and are familiar with the show's style. The humor relies on the audience's understanding of the double meaning of the word "snatch" and their willingness to appreciate the innuendo. If the audience is receptive to this type of humor, the joke should land effectively.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort

# Phil's second guest is Radio 1 star DJ and TV presenter Lisa I'Anson. Lisa's had a long association with pop music and recently worked with Wings. She does the voiceover on the Bodyform ads.

**Intended Humor**
This introduction does not contain a joke. It provides information about Lisa I'Anson's background, association with pop music, and recent work with Wings. The mention of her doing the voiceover on the Bodyform ads might be seen as a humorous detail, but it does not constitute a joke in itself.

**Why it's not a joke**
This introduction is purely informational, highlighting Lisa I'Anson's credentials and recent work. It does not contain any comedic elements or play on words.

# Shaun's first guest is Shovell, percussionist with M People.

**Intended Humor**
This introduction does not contain a joke. It provides information about Shovell being a percussionist with M People. While the mention of his name "Shovell" might sound like a play on words with "shovel," it does not constitute a joke as there is no further comedic element or punchline associated with it.

**Why it's not a joke**
This introduction is purely informational, stating Shovell's profession and association with the band M People. It does not contain any comedic elements or play on words.

# Shaun's second guest is heartthrob and platinum-selling pop sensation Mark Owen. Mark used to work in a bank but now gets hundreds of fan letters a week. He replies diligently to every letter and charges a mere 15-pound administration fee for each one.

**Intended Humor**
This introduction contains a joke. The humor comes from the contrast between Mark Owen being described as a heartthrob and platinum-selling pop sensation, and the fact that he charges a 15-pound administration fee for replying to fan letters. The joke plays on the idea of a heartthrob pop star charging fans for the privilege of receiving a response from him, subverting the expectation that he would freely engage with his fans.

**How it Lands**
The joke would likely land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the show's style of humor and appreciate the subversion of expectations. The humor relies on the audience's understanding of the pop star persona and their willingness to find amusement in the idea of charging fans for a reply. If the audience appreciates this type of irony and satire, the joke should land effectively.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 02: Gary Barlow, Edwyn Collins, Jeff Green, Tony Wright

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Scottish singer-songwriter, Edwin Collins. Edwin's first job was as an artist in Glasgow’s parks. His finest works included Still Life with Park Bench, Dead Tramp in Hedge, and the classic Dog Crapping on Bowling Green.

Sean's second guest is comedian Jeff Green. Embarrassingly, Jeff was once a fan of soprano choir boy Aled Jones, and then the penny dropped, among other things. 

Phil's first guest is Tony Wright, singer with Brit rock gods, Terrorvision. The band are such hellraisers that on a tour of America, they once carried on partying during an earthquake. In fact, the first they knew about it was when Charlton Heston appeared and led them to safety.

Phil's second guest is Gary Barlow. He's now a successful solo artist, and we've been asked not to mention his boy band past. He can take almost anything but he can't take that. I'm sorry about that Gary.

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Sean's first guest: Edwin Collins

**Intended Humor**
- The introduction contains a joke.
- The joke is a play on the idea of Edwin Collins being an artist in Glasgow's parks.
- The humor lies in the absurdity and the exaggerated titles of Edwin's "finest works," such as "Still Life with Park Bench," "Dead Tramp in Hedge," and "Dog Crapping on Bowling Green." These titles are unexpected and amusing because they highlight mundane and unappealing subjects for a painting.

**How it Lands**
- Considering the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of comedy and music, the joke is likely to land well. The audience would be familiar with the format of the show and its humorous tone.
- The joke is fairly funny, as it relies on the unexpected and absurd titles of Edwin's "finest works." It plays on the stereotype of unconventional and obscure art, which can be amusing to many viewers.

# Sean's second guest: Jeff Green

**Intended Humor**
- The introduction contains a joke.
- The joke is based on a play on words with the phrase "the penny dropped."
- The humor lies in the double entendre, where "the penny dropped" can mean both realizing something and a euphemism for an erection. The joke suggests that Jeff Green was once a fan of soprano choir boy Aled Jones until he realized something (the penny dropped), implying a humorous innuendo.

**How it Lands**
- Considering the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of comedy and music, the joke is likely to land well. The audience would be familiar with the show's humor and be open to innuendos and playful wordplay.
- The joke is moderately funny, as it relies on a clever play on words. It may elicit a chuckle or a slight laugh from the audience.

**Intended Humor**
- The introduction contains a joke.
- The joke is based on a humorous twist related to the band Terrorvision and their partying habits.
- The humor lies in the unexpected twist of the band partying during an earthquake in America. The punchline is that the band was unaware of the earthquake until Charlton Heston appeared and led them to safety. The absurdity of the situation and the juxtaposition of a rock band being oblivious to a natural disaster add to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
- Considering the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of comedy and music, the joke is likely to land well. The audience would be familiar with the show's humor and appreciate the unexpected twist in the story.
- The joke is quite funny, as it relies on the absurdity of the situation and the reference to Charlton Heston. It may elicit a laugh or a smile from the audience.

# Phil's second guest: Gary Barlow

**Intended Humor**
- The introduction contains a joke.
- The joke is based on the idea of Gary Barlow not wanting his boy band past to be mentioned.
- The humor lies in the irony and the exaggerated reaction implied by the statement "He can take almost anything but he can't take that." The joke suggests that Gary Barlow is sensitive about his boy band past, which is amusing because it contrasts with his successful solo career and highlights a potential insecurity.

**How it Lands**
- Considering the show's typical audience, which consists of fans of comedy and music, the joke is likely to land well. The audience would be familiar with the show's humor and appreciate the playful jab at Gary Barlow's sensitivity.
- The joke is mildly funny, as it relies on the irony and the exaggeration of Gary's reaction. It may elicit a smile or a slight laugh from the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**

- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 2. A minor exhale out the nose

# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Shelly Poole from platinum album sellers Alisha’s Attic. Shelly’s dad Brian was a rock star in the sixties, so he’d shout things like turn that bloody music up! What time do I call this! And: get upstairs and trash your bedroom! Sean’s second guest is Math Priest from top five stars and Britpop heroes Dodgy. Dodgy recently went on a tour of Sarajevo, where they argued so much that the Bosnian Serbs offered to mediate a band meeting. Shelly and Math, ladies and gentlemen, Sean’s team. 

Phil’s first guest is legendary singer-songwriter Midge Ure. Midge has sung vocals on three number ones by different artists, and what an enjoyable evening’s karaoke that turned out to be. Phil’s second guest is comedian Graham Norton. Since Graham took over the nightly chat show on Channel Five, he’s become famous wherever he goes. Inside the Channel Five Building, ladies and gentlemen, Midge and Graham, Phil’s team.

What time do I call this! And: get upstairs and trash your bedroom! Sean’s second guest is Math Priest from top five stars and Britpop heroes Dodgy. Dodgy recently went on a tour of Sarajevo, where they argued so much that the Bosnian Serbs offered to mediate a band meeting. Shelly and Math, ladies and gentlemen, Sean’s team.

** Intended Humour **
The joke in this introduction revolves around the idea of the guests' parents and their behavior. The humor comes from the exaggeration and absurdity of the situations described. 

In the case of Shelly Poole, her dad Brian being a rock star in the sixties is used as a setup for the punchline. The exaggerated statements of what he would shout, such as "turn that bloody music up!", "What time do I call this!", and "get upstairs and trash your bedroom!" are meant to be comically over-the-top. The humor comes from the image of a rock star dad behaving in an exaggeratedly strict and demanding manner.

For Math Priest, the joke revolves around the band Dodgy's recent tour of Sarajevo. The setup is that they argued so much during the tour that the Bosnian Serbs offered to mediate a band meeting. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation and the exaggerated nature of the argument. It plays on the stereotype of bands having internal conflicts and disagreements, but takes it to an extreme by involving the Bosnian Serbs as mediators.

** How it Lands **
Considering the typical audience of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which is a comedy panel show focused on music, these jokes are likely to land well. The audience is likely to be familiar with the rock star stereotype and the dynamics within bands, making them more likely to find the humor relatable and amusing.

In terms of how funny the jokes are, they both rely on exaggeration and absurdity for comedic effect. The jokes are not particularly clever or witty, but they rely on the delivery and timing of the host, Sean, to enhance their humor. The exaggerations and absurdities in the jokes are meant to be laugh-out-loud funny, aiming for a strong reaction from the audience.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, these jokes would likely be rated as a 3: An audible snort. The jokes rely on exaggeration and absurdity, which can elicit a chuckle or snort from the audience, but may not necessarily result in a full-on laugh or rolling on the floor.

From the perspective of a comedy writer, these jokes would likely be rated as a 2: A minor exhale out the nose. While the jokes rely on exaggeration and absurdity, they may not be considered particularly clever or innovative in terms of comedy writing. They rely more on the delivery and timing of the host to enhance their humor rather than the jokes themselves being inherently funny.

# Phil’s first guest is legendary singer-songwriter Midge Ure. Midge has sung vocals on three number ones by different artists, and what an enjoyable evening’s karaoke that turned out to be. Phil’s second guest is comedian Graham Norton. Since Graham took over the nightly chat show on Channel Five, he’s become famous wherever he goes. Inside the Channel Five Building, ladies and gentlemen, Midge and Graham, Phil’s team.

** Intended Humour **
This introduction contains two jokes, one for each guest. 

The joke for Midge Ure revolves around his experience singing vocals on three number ones by different artists. The setup is that it was an enjoyable evening's karaoke. The humor comes from the contrast between the casual and fun activity of karaoke and the significance and success of singing on number one hits. The joke plays on the irony and unexpectedness of the situation.

For Graham Norton, the joke revolves around his fame since taking over the nightly chat show on Channel Five. The setup is that he has become famous wherever he goes. The punchline is delivered with the location "Inside the Channel Five Building." The humor comes from the play on words and the double meaning of "famous wherever he goes." The joke suggests that Graham is only famous within the confines of the Channel Five Building, emphasizing the absurdity and limited scope of his fame.

** How it Lands **
Considering the typical audience of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which is a comedy panel show focused on music, these jokes are likely to land well. The audience is likely to be familiar with Midge Ure's music career and Graham Norton's celebrity status, making them more likely to find the humor relatable and amusing.

In terms of how funny the jokes are, they both rely on wordplay and irony for comedic effect. The jokes are not particularly clever or groundbreaking, but they rely on the delivery and timing of the host, Phil, to enhance their humor. The humor comes from the unexpectedness and playfulness of the punchlines.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home, these jokes would likely be rated as a 3: An audible snort. The jokes rely on wordplay and irony, which can elicit a chuckle or snort from the audience, but may not necessarily result in a full-on laugh or rolling on the floor.

From the perspective of a comedy writer, these jokes would likely be rated as a 2: A minor exhale out the nose. While the jokes rely on wordplay and irony, they may not be considered particularly clever or innovative in terms of comedy writing. They rely more on the delivery and timing of the host to enhance their humor rather than the jokes themselves being inherently funny.

Judge Analysis: The model missed the key element of role reversal that makes the joke work - instead interpreting it as simply 'exaggerated strict parenting,' which is exactly opposite to the actual joke. The gold standard correctly identifies that the humor comes from a rock star parent encouraging rather than discouraging rock star behavior. The model's ratings roughly align with the gold standard but seem accidental given the fundamental misunderstanding.

Judge Analysis: The model's analysis is superficial, focusing only on 'absurdity' and 'exaggeration' while missing the clever layering identified in the gold standard - particularly the irony of Bosnian Serbs as peace mediators in the 90s context. The model doesn't recognize the crafted nature of the joke that makes it stand out. Rating alignment seems coincidental rather than based on genuine understanding.

Judge Analysis: The model correctly identifies the basic structure but provides little insight into why it's a 'serviceable but uninspired' joke as noted in the gold standard. The analysis is accurate but shallow, missing context about Channel Five's status in UK broadcasting that makes the joke work. Rating accuracy is good though slightly higher than gold standard suggests.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 03: Billy Bragg, Sarah Blackwood, Richard Fairbrass, Neil Morrissey

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean’s first guest is the one and only Richard Fairbrass.
Too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt.
So sexy.
Formerly the singer with Right Said Fred it was only when he got the job on BBC Two's, Gay Time TV, that Richard had to sit his parents down and confess that he’d become a TV presenter.
Sean’s second guest is Essex-born singer-songwriter Billy Bragg.
In his youth, Billy joined the army but bought himself out after only 90 days. Later we'll be having a whip round to see if we can buy him back in. 

Phil's first guest is Sarah Blackwood, singer with glamorous Northern electropopsters Dubstar.
Sarah was once scolded by her mum for saying the word “blimey” on Richard and Judy. Quite right too. The words “tosser” and “irritating old hag” would have been far more appropriate. Phil's second guest is Neil Morrissey. He's an actor who comes from Stoke where remarkably his hairstyle is still ahead of the times.

# Sean’s second guest is Essex-born singer-songwriter Billy Bragg.
**Intended Humor**
The joke in this introduction is a play on words. The phrase "whip round" is used to suggest that the show will collect money to "buy back in" Billy Bragg to the army.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 01: Marie DuSantiago, Mark Little, Shaggy, Suggs

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Marie De Santiago, the guitarist in Sunderland's Kenickie. They've been called the Cities answer to the Spice Girls, which is of course ridiculous. Their music is much better and their combined age is still younger than Ginger Spice. Sean's second guest is actor and comedian Mark Little. He played Joe Mangle in neighbors and then spent two years doing The Big Breakfast with extra sausages by the look of it.

Phil's first guest is Suggs. After his last appearance on the show the Madness frontman announced his total retirement from pop quizzes. He spent the last year hosting a pop quiz and here he is tonight on a pop quiz. Sean's other guest is Jamaican superstar Shaggy. He took his name from one of the characters in Scooby Doo. He chose Shaggy because "fat bird with the pleated skirt and glasses" didn't have the right ring to it.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Marie De Santiago's intro
** Intended Humour **
- The joke in this introduction is the comparison between Kenickie and the Spice Girls. The line "They've been called the Cities answer to the Spice Girls, which is of course ridiculous" sets up a humorous contrast between the two bands. The punchline is that Kenickie's music is much better and their combined age is still younger than Ginger Spice.
- The joke works by playing with the audience's expectation of the Spice Girls being a popular and successful girl group. By stating that Kenickie is the "Cities answer to the Spice Girls," the joke subverts this expectation and highlights the absurdity of the comparison.
- The humor also comes from the exaggeration of Kenickie's superiority over the Spice Girls. By saying that their music is "much better" and their combined age is still younger than Ginger Spice, the joke creates a humorous image of Kenickie being more talented and youthful than the Spice Girls.

** How it Lands ** 
- The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are fans of music and comedy. The comparison between Kenickie and the Spice Girls would be relatable to the audience, as both bands were popular during the same era.
- The humor in this joke is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's taste. However, the exaggeration and unexpected comparison between the two bands are elements that often resonate with audiences and can elicit laughter.

** Funniness Ratings ** 
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3. An audible snort

# Mark Little's intro
** Intended Humour **
- The joke in this introduction is a play on words and a humorous observation about Mark Little's appearance. The line "He played Joe Mangle in neighbors and then spent two years doing The Big Breakfast with extra sausages by the look of it" is a pun on the phrase "extra sausages" and a literal interpretation of it.
- The joke works by using wordplay and exaggeration. The phrase "extra sausages" is usually used to refer to something additional or excessive, but in this context, it is taken literally to imply that Mark Little has physically gained weight during his time on The Big Breakfast. The humor comes from the unexpected and exaggerated interpretation of the phrase.

** How it Lands ** 
- The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with Mark Little's appearance and have a sense of humor that appreciates wordplay and observational humor.
- The humor in this joke is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's taste. However, the use of wordplay and exaggeration are often effective techniques in comedy and can elicit laughter.

** Funniness Ratings ** 
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3. An audible snort

# Suggs' intro
** Intended Humour **
- The joke in this introduction is a play on Suggs' previous retirement announcement and his subsequent appearance on a pop quiz show. The line "After his last appearance on the show, the Madness frontman announced his total retirement from pop quizzes. He spent the last year hosting a pop quiz and here he is tonight on a pop quiz" sets up a humorous contradiction between Suggs' retirement announcement and his current appearance on the show.
- The joke works by highlighting the irony of Suggs' retirement announcement and his subsequent return to hosting a pop quiz. The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the absurdity of his actions.

** How it Lands ** 
- The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with Suggs and his involvement in pop quizzes. The irony and contradiction in this joke are elements that often resonate with audiences and can elicit laughter.
- The humor in this joke is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's taste. However, the use of irony and the unexpected twist are often effective techniques in comedy and can elicit laughter.

** Funniness Ratings ** 
- From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3. An audible snort
- From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3. An audible snort

# Shaggy's intro
** Intended Humour **
- The joke in this introduction is a humorous explanation of why Shaggy chose his stage name. The line "He took his name from one of the characters in Scooby Doo. He chose Shaggy because 'fat bird with the pleated skirt and glasses' didn't have the right ring to it" sets up a humorous contrast between Shaggy's chosen name and the alternative option.
- The joke works by playing with the audience's expectation of Shaggy's stage name origin. The character Shaggy in Scooby Doo is known for being laid-back, unkempt, and often hungry. By stating that Shaggy chose his name from this character, the joke subverts the expectation of a more glamorous or cool origin for his stage name.
- The humor also comes from the exaggeration and absurdity of the alternative option for his stage name. By describing it as a "fat bird with the pleated skirt and glasses," the joke creates a humorous image of a less appealing and less catchy name.

** How it Lands ** 
- The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are fans of music and comedy. The reference to Scooby Doo and the unexpected origin of Shaggy's name are elements that often resonate with audiences and can elicit laughter.
- The humor in this joke is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's taste. However, the use of contrast, exaggeration, and unexpected origin are often effective techniques in comedy and can elicit laughter.
