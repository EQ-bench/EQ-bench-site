#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
And on his team tonight: 

Get off the Dog and Bone and rush down the Apples and Stairs, you'll never guess who's on the Bella Vision jet… It's cheeky Cockney and movie star, Danny Dyer! 

And from ratings-winning band The Long Blondes, it's the lead singer we've all very much heard of… Please don't turn off… It's Kate Jackson! 

And on Phil's team tonight: 

Look, it's the drummer from McFly! They totally appeal to me and my demographic. I'm going to watch this. It's Harry from McFly! 

He's a comedian and actor from the Flight of the Conchords. You can talk all the way through if you like, as long as you keep the TV on. It's Rhys Darby!

# Danny Dyer's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction for Danny Dyer is a play on words, incorporating classic Cockney rhyming slang to create a humorous effect. The phrase "Get off the Dog and Bone" means to get off the phone, and "Apples and Stairs" is rhyming slang for "stairs." The use of "Bella Vision jet" is not a typical Cockney phrase but is included to add to the comedic buildup of using an airline name to introduce a celebrity guest. The humor is intended to be a lighthearted and playful take on Danny Dyer's Cockney persona.

The main comedic element is the unexpected twist on the typical introduction format, using rhyming slang to create a sense of wordplay. The phrase "you'll never guess who's on the Bella Vision jet" adds to the comedic tension, implying that the introduction is going to be a grand reveal.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with Cockney rhyming slang, this introduction will likely elicit a chuckle. The use of wordplay and the unexpected twist on the typical introduction format will create a sense of delight and playfulness. The humor is not complex or layered, but it is effective in creating a lighthearted and entertaining introduction.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 2.5 (Between a minor exhale out the nose and an audible snort)

# Kate Jackson's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction for Kate Jackson is a tongue-in-cheek commentary on her relative fame. The phrase "the lead singer we've all very much heard of" is a sarcastic remark implying that Kate Jackson is not a household name. The added phrase "Please don't turn off" is a humorous plea to the audience to stay engaged, despite the introduction of a potentially lesser-known celebrity.

The comedic element is the self-aware, meta commentary on the show's introduction format. The humor is intended to be ironic and lighthearted, poking fun at the idea that the show needs to introduce a celebrity who may not be well-known.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the show's irreverent humor, this introduction will likely elicit a chuckle. The use of sarcasm and self-aware commentary will create a sense of irony and playfulness. However, the humor may not land as well for viewers who are not familiar with the show's tone.

From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3.5 (Between an audible snort and LOL)

# Harry from McFly's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction for Harry from McFly is a humorous commentary on the show's demographics. The phrase "They totally appeal to me and my demographic" is a tongue-in-cheek remark implying that the show's host is not actually a fan of McFly, but rather is trying to appeal to a younger audience. The added phrase "I'm going to watch this" is a humorous aside, implying that the host is only interested in the show because of Harry's appearance.

The comedic element is the self-aware commentary on the show's demographics and the host's persona. The humor is intended to be ironic and lighthearted, poking fun at the idea that the show needs to appeal to a specific age group.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the show's irreverent humor, this introduction will likely elicit a chuckle. The use of sarcasm and self-aware commentary will create a sense of irony and playfulness. However, the humor may not land as well for viewers who are not familiar with the show's tone.

# Rhys Darby's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction for Rhys Darby is a humorous commentary on the show's ratings and the audience's attention span. The phrase "You can talk all the way through if you like, as long as you keep the TV on" is a tongue-in-cheek remark implying that the show's host is more concerned with keeping the audience engaged than with actually listening to the guest.

The comedic element is the self-aware commentary on the show's ratings and the audience's behavior. The humor is intended to be ironic and lighthearted, poking fun at the idea that the show needs to keep the audience engaged at all costs.

Judge Analysis: The model completely missed the core joke about mangled/deteriorating Cockney rhyming slang. It treated 'Apples and Stairs' as legitimate rhyming slang rather than understanding it's deliberately wrong. It also missed the meta-commentary on Dyer's persona. The funniness ratings were significantly lower than the gold standard's 5/5 ratings, suggesting it didn't grasp why this would be particularly funny to both audiences.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 22 Episode 01: Adele, Jamie Reynolds, Ralf Little, Tim Minchin

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Mark's team tonight, she's usually chasing pavements, but tonight, pavements, you can take the evening off because she's not chasing you, she's chasing points! It's song sensation and points meshuggener, Adele. Also on Mark's team, not that we're panicking about the loss of anyone in particular, but it's comedian with a piano, Tim, just in case, Minchin.  And on Phil's team tonight, "Honk! Honk!" That's the sound of a klaxon. But what does this one sound like? Like a bloody cool human, we hope, it's one of The Klaxons, Jamie Reynolds from The Klaxons! And Phil's second guest is an actor with the charisma and talent to make anything he's in, however bad the script, seem like it certainly should be good enough for BBC3. It's Ralf Little, everybody!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Adele's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on words, using Adele's song title "Chasing Pavements" and giving it a literal twist. The punchline "pavements, you can take the evening off" is a clever and unexpected turn, creating humor through its absurdity. The use of personification, where pavements are treated as entities that can take time off, adds to the comedic effect. The second part of the intro, calling Adele a "points meshuggener," is a lighthearted jab at her competitive nature, using a playful Yiddish term to create a humorous and whimsical tone.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to resonate with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with Adele's music and appreciate wordplay. The unexpected twist on the song title creates a sense of surprise, which contributes to the humor. However, the joke's impact might be slightly diminished for viewers who are not familiar with Adele's music or the specific song reference.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4 (LOL)

# Tim Minchin's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke is a clever quip about the show's potential loss of a team member, with Tim Minchin being introduced as a backup plan. The humor comes from the unexpected and exaggerated reaction to a hypothetical situation, creating a comedic sense of panic. The use of the phrase "not that we're panicking" is a clear indicator of irony, adding to the humor.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it's a relatable and lighthearted take on a common situation. The quick wit and clever wordplay make it an enjoyable and amusing introduction.

# Jamie Reynolds' intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on expectations, setting up the sound of a klaxon, only to subvert it with a clever and unexpected twist. The humor comes from the surprise and the clever connection between the sound effect and the band's name, The Klaxons.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it's a quick and clever play on words. The use of the sound effect adds to the comedic effect, creating a sense of anticipation and surprise.

# Ralf Little's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke is a lighthearted and playful jab at Ralf Little's acting career, implying that he has the talent to make even bad scripts seem good. The humor comes from the clever wordplay and the unexpected twist on the typical introduction format. The use of the phrase "seem like it certainly should be good enough for BBC3" is a clever and ironic take on the channel's reputation, adding to the humor.

Judge Analysis: The model misses key elements of the joke's intentional corniness and self-awareness. While it identifies the wordplay, it fails to recognize how the joke deliberately leans into its groan-worthy nature. The model rates it too highly at 4/5 when the gold standard recognizes it as a 3/5 'audible snort' level joke. The analysis is superficial compared to the gold standard's insight about anti-humor.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 22 Episode 10: 198th Episode Special - Arlene Phillips, Keith Murray, Dappy, Robert Webb

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Lee's first guest might be known for her role on a certain popular soap opera, but tonight she's stepping out of the cobbled streets and onto our panel. She's the girl-next-door with a quick wit and sharper tongue, it's Coronation Street's very own Sally Lindsay!

And joining Sally is a music legend who's seen it all and performed with the biggest names in the industry. He's written hits that have stood the test of time, and he's still going strong. Please welcome, from the legendary band Squeeze, it's singer-songwriter Chris Difford!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#


# Sally Lindsay's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a subtle joke. The intended humor lies in the contrast between Sally Lindsay's persona as a "girl-next-door" and the revelation that she has a "sharper tongue." The joke relies on the unexpected twist on the typical "girl-next-door" trope, which is often associated with innocence and kindness. The phrase "sharper tongue" implies that Sally is not as sweet and innocent as her on-screen persona might suggest. The humor is also slightly enhanced by the use of the phrase "cobbled streets," which is a nod to Coronation Street's iconic setting.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land reasonably well. The audience is likely familiar with Coronation Street and the "girl-next-door" trope, making the subversion of expectations mildly amusing. The joke is not laugh-out-loud funny, but it might elicit a minor chuckle or a slight smile from the audience. The humor is not overly complex, but it's a clever play on words that adds a bit of personality to Sally's introduction.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 2.5 (a minor exhale out the nose, with a slight chance of a small chuckle)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 3 (an audible snort, acknowledging the clever wordplay)

# Chris Difford's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction does not contain a joke. The text is purely informational, highlighting Chris Difford's achievements and credentials as a music legend. The tone is respectful and celebratory, with no apparent attempt at humor.

**Why it's not a joke**
The introduction is a straightforward presentation of Chris Difford's impressive background and accomplishments. The language is formal and complimentary, without any clever twists or wordplay that might suggest an attempt at humor. The purpose of this introduction is to establish Chris Difford's credibility and prestige, rather than to elicit laughter.

**No Funniness Ratings**
As there is no joke present, funniness ratings are not applicable.

Judge Analysis: The model incorrectly identified humor where none existed. The gold standard clearly states this was a straightforward, non-comedic introduction, but the model fabricated a joke about 'girl-next-door' vs 'sharper tongue' contrast. This shows poor judgment in humor identification. The model's theory of mind analysis and funniness ratings are irrelevant since there was no actual joke to analyze. The depth of analysis, while detailed, was completely off-base.

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Itâ€™s the award winning, platinum selling singer of Cage the Elephant, and weâ€™re delighted to have him here. Tonight, with just three outrageous lies in his intro, it's Matt Shultz!

And she's a fiercely intelligent Oxford-educated comedian and actor. Stephen Fry'd better watch out, because she's also a murderer! It's Josie Long!

On Phil's team tonight, former S Club Junior and now in new girl band The Saturdays. There's nothing wrong with dressing her all sexy now, and we can't change the past. It's Frankie Sandford!

And also on Phil's team is the up-and-coming star of Mamma Mia, The History Boys, and The Duchess. Oh, him? I love him! Such a recognizable face. Go on, give us a clue. I'm sorry, your time's up. It's Dominic Cooper!

# Matt Shultz's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on a play on expectations, setting up the audience to anticipate a typical introduction, but subverting it by claiming that there are "just three outrageous lies" in the intro, only to not provide any outlandish or humorous claims about Matt Shultz. The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the deadpan delivery.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, familiar with the format and tone of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, this joke might elicit a chuckle. The audience is likely to appreciate the clever wordplay and the unexpected twist. However, the joke's impact might be limited by its subtlety, and some viewers might not catch the humor.

# Josie Long's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke starts by setting up Josie Long as a respectable and intelligent individual, only to suddenly claim that she's a murderer. The humor comes from the unexpected and absurd twist, as well as the clever connection to Stephen Fry, implying that he should be worried. The use of a well-known figure like Stephen Fry adds to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it's a clever play on expectations, and the absurdity of the claim is humorous. The audience will appreciate the quick wit and clever writing.

# Frankie Sandford's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on a play on the audience's perception of Frankie Sandford's past as a member of S Club Junior. The humor comes from the implication that she's now being "dressed all sexy" as a member of The Saturdays, and the tongue-in-cheek comment that "we can't change the past." The joke is a commentary on the music industry's tendency to sexualize young performers.

**How it Lands**
This joke might elicit a mix of reactions from the audience. Some might find it funny, while others might be slightly uncomfortable with the topic. The joke's impact depends on the audience's familiarity with Frankie Sandford's past and their sensitivity to the issue.

# Dominic Cooper's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on a play on the audience's expectation of recognizing a famous person. The humor comes from the clever writing, which sets up the audience to expect a typical introduction, only to subvert it by pretending that Dominic Cooper is not well-known. The use of a timer and the phrase "I'm sorry, your time's up" adds to the comedic effect, implying that the audience should be familiar with him, but are not.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it's a clever play on expectations, and the absurdity of the situation is humorous. The audience will appreciate the quick wit and clever writing.

# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight, if you like top electro-pop band Hot Chip, you'll love this next guest. He's from top electro-pop band Hot Chip, it's Joe Goddard. You know, from Hot Chip. And Stephen Fry did pull out at the last minute, but I'm sure whoever we replaced him with will be a brilliant established or up-and-coming man or woman. Oh, it's the IT crowd's Chris O'Dowd, good.

Phil's first guest is the star of Cold Feet and Murphy's Law, it's the thinking woman's drunken, slutty sister's crumpet, James Nesbitt. And taking the temporarily cool dude indie star seat tonight, it's Adam from Flipchart Hiatus. Sorry, hang on, I've just been told, Flipchart Hiatus have slipped a couple of places in the cool list and we're gonna have to replace him with the very talented cool dude indie star, Lightspeed Champion, everybody!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Joe Goddard's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on the anticipation and subsequent subversion of a typical introductory phrase. The host starts by saying "if you like top electro-pop band Hot Chip, you'll love this next guest," which primes the audience to expect a comparison or a surprise reveal. However, the punchline "He's from top electro-pop band Hot Chip" is a straightforward statement that doesn't deliver the expected twist. The humor comes from the unexpected lack of creativity in the introduction, poking fun at the typical format of such intros. The repetition of "from Hot Chip" drives the point home, making it clear that the host is not trying to be clever or original.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the format and can appreciate the self-aware, meta humor. The joke doesn't rely on complex references or inside knowledge, making it accessible to a wide range of viewers. The deadpan delivery and the host's nonchalant attitude add to the comedic effect, making it a well-crafted joke.

# Chris O'Dowd's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction starts with a fake apology for Stephen Fry's absence, setting up the expectation that the replacement guest will be someone equally impressive. However, the host quickly reveals that the replacement is Chris O'Dowd, which is not a surprise or a disappointment. The humor comes from the unnecessary apology and the build-up, which is immediately deflated by the straightforward announcement of the guest's name. The phrase "good" at the end is a non-sequitur, adding to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it plays on the expectation of a typical introduction. The quick subversion of the apology and the casual announcement of Chris O'Dowd's name create a comedic effect that is both unexpected and delightful.

The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the absurdity of the "cool list" concept.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 09: Mark Watson, Christopher Biggins, Robyn, Sam Duckworth

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight, he's on every other TV show to celebrate his "King of the Jungle" triumph; one more won't hurt, surely? It's Christopher Biggins! And taking advantage of nothing else being released at the moment, it's indie sensation and big fish in an empty pond, Get Cape Wear Cape Fly!

Phil's first guest is a chart-topping pop phenomenon whose album is still nearly full price in many shops; it's Robin! And he also has a brilliant comedian and a talented author, yet strangely available during such a busy time for comedy and books, it's Mark Watson!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Christopher Biggins' intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on Christopher Biggins' overexposure on TV after his "King of the Jungle" triumph in a reality TV show. The phrase "one more won't hurt, surely?" is a tongue-in-cheek commentary on his ubiquity. The humor is intended to be ironic, implying that Biggins is already everywhere, so adding one more appearance won't make a difference.

The joke works because it plays on the common perception that reality TV stars often overstay their welcome in the public eye. The humor also comes from the dry wit and sarcasm in the phrase "one more won't hurt, surely?" which is a classic British understatement.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with British reality TV and its tendency to create fleeting celebrities, this joke is likely to resonate. The audience will understand the reference to Biggins' overexposure and appreciate the wry commentary.

The joke is funny because it's a quick, clever jab at a familiar target. The delivery is also important, as the deadpan tone adds to the humor.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

# Get Cape Wear Cape Fly's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke is a play on the phrase "big fish in a small pond," but replaces "small pond" with "empty pond." This is a clever and humorous way to describe Get Cape Wear Cape Fly as an indie sensation who is only successful because there's a lack of competition.

The joke works because it's a clever wordplay on a familiar phrase. The humor also comes from the unexpected twist on the usual phrase, which creates a unexpected punchline.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the indie music scene and its tendency to create niche celebrities, this joke is likely to resonate. The audience will appreciate the clever wordplay and the wry commentary on Get Cape Wear Cape Fly's success.

The joke is funny because it's a quick, clever jab at a familiar target. The delivery is also important, as the deadpan tone adds to the humor.

# Robin's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on the fact that Robin's album is still nearly full price in many shops, implying that it's not selling well. The humor is intended to be ironic, implying that a chart-topping pop phenomenon should have an album that's flying off the shelves, not languishing at full price.

The joke works because it's a clever play on the usual expectation of a successful pop star. The humor also comes from the unexpected twist on the usual expectation, which creates a unexpected punchline.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the music industry and its tendency to create fleeting successes, this joke is likely to resonate. The audience will appreciate the wry commentary on Robin's album sales.

The joke is funny because it's a quick, clever jab at a familiar target. The delivery is also important, as the deadpan tone adds to the humor.

# Mark Watson's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on the fact that Mark Watson is a brilliant comedian and talented author, yet is available to appear on the show during a busy time for comedy and books. The humor is intended to be ironic, implying that someone as talented as Watson should be in high demand, not available to appear on a TV show.

The joke works because it's a clever play on the usual expectation of a successful comedian and author. The humor also comes from the unexpected twist on the usual expectation, which creates a unexpected punchline.

**How it Lands**

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 10: Sophie Ellis Bextor, Yannis, Tim Minchin, James Lance

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is the lead singer with The Foals... Well if their recent invasion of January is anything to go by, I wouldn't want to be February right now. It’s Yannis Philippakis.

And an award-winning stand-up who fuses comedy with music, he could be a bit like Bill Bailey if it wasn't for his grotesquely freakish, almost non-human appearance. It's the very different to Bill Bailey, Tim Minchin everybody!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Yannis Philippakis' intro

**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke is a play on words, using the idea of The Foals "invasion of January" (likely referring to their music being popular or dominant during that time) and extrapolating it to a humorous and exaggerated situation where February is personified and should be afraid. The joke relies on a quick mental shift from a literal music chart performance to an imaginative scenario where months are entities that can be invaded or threatened. The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the clever wordplay.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, which is likely familiar with music and British culture, this joke would likely resonate well. The joke doesn't require extensive knowledge of The Foals or their music, but rather a basic understanding of how music charts work and a willingness to follow the clever wordplay. The humor is not laugh-out-loud hilarious but rather a clever and witty remark that might elicit a snort or a minor laugh.

**Funniness Ratings**

* From the audience's perspective: 3 (An audible snort)
* From a comedy writer's perspective: 4 (LOL)

The joke is well-crafted and showcases the writer's creativity, but its impact might be somewhat limited by its reliance on a specific cultural reference (The Foals' music) and the audience's familiarity with the subject matter.

# Tim Minchin's intro

**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke is a witty remark that uses a backhanded compliment to poke fun at Tim Minchin's appearance. The joke starts by setting up a comparison between Tim Minchin and Bill Bailey, implying that they share similarities in their comedy styles. However, it quickly subverts this expectation by highlighting their physical differences, using an exaggerated and humorous description of Tim Minchin's appearance as "grotesquely freakish, almost non-human." The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the ridiculousness of the description.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, which is likely familiar with both Tim Minchin and Bill Bailey, this joke would likely land well. The joke relies on a basic understanding of the two comedians and their styles, and the humor is not mean-spirited but rather playful and lighthearted. However, some audience members might find the joke slightly off-putting or insensitive, depending on their personal opinions about appearance and humor.

**Funniness Ratings**

* From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
* From a comedy writer's perspective: 5 (ROFL)

The joke is expertly crafted, using a clever setup and subversion to create humor. The writer's use of language is playful and creative, making the joke both funny and memorable. However, as with any joke that relies on physical appearance, there's a risk that some audience members might not find it as funny or might even be offended.

Judge Analysis: The model completely misread this joke, inventing a coherent explanation where the gold standard notes the joke is unclear and lacks context. The model constructed an elaborate but incorrect interpretation about chart performance and wordplay, when the gold standard correctly identifies it as a failed joke due to missing context. The model's high funniness ratings (3/4) contrast sharply with the gold standard's 1/1, showing poor judgment of comedic effectiveness.

Contestant: Tim Minchin
Judge Analysis: The model missed the key element of ambiguity that makes this joke work - it incorrectly assumed the joke was straightforwardly about Minchin's appearance, while the gold standard explains how the humor comes from clever misdirection about whether it's referring to Minchin or Bailey. While the model's funniness ratings (4/5) are close to gold standard (4/4), it arrived there for wrong reasons. The analysis shows surface-level understanding but misses the sophisticated comedy writing technique identified in the gold standard.

# Mark Ronson's intro

**Intended Humour**
The introduction for Mark Ronson contains a joke. It starts with "Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ, the everlasting lord" which is a clear exaggeration and sets the tone for the humorous tone of the rest of the intro. The punchline "he put the Wine into Winehouse" is a play on words referencing Mark Ronson's collaboration with Amy Winehouse on her album "Back to Black". This joke relies on wordplay and the unexpected twist on the phrase. The use of "irresponsible cool dude producer" to describe Mark Ronson is also intended to be humorous as it pokes fun at his public image.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with Mark Ronson's work and the music industry. The wordplay is clever and unexpected, making it likely to elicit a laugh. However, the joke may not be as funny to those who are not familiar with Mark Ronson's collaboration with Amy Winehouse.

# Vic from Vic and Nancy's intro

**Intended Humour**
The introduction for Vic from Vic and Nancy contains a joke. The use of the phrase "And you can be the hottest, you can be the finest, it don't matter to me" is a clear setup for a punchline. The punchline "it's one half of my favourite double act in the history of I'm a Celebrity, it's Vic from Vic and Nancy" is humorous because it subverts expectations. The setup suggests that Vic is being introduced as a desirable or impressive person, but the punchline reveals that he is actually being introduced as part of a relatively unknown celebrity duo.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the format of the show and the types of celebrities that appear on it. The joke relies on the unexpected twist and the self-deprecation of the host, making it likely to elicit a laugh.

On Noel's team tonight, the former star of Coronation Street, star of soap star superstar, now starring as a pop star, even his album's got one star, it's Richard Fleeshman.

It's Kristen Schaal.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Bobby Davro's intro
** Intended Humour **
Bobby Davro's introduction is humorous because of its unexpected twist. The phrase "one of the biggest impression-based comedians of the 80s" initially primes the audience to expect that Bobby Davro will be introduced in a serious and respectful manner, given his background as a well-known comedian. However, the punchline "doing a pretty good Shane Richie" subverts this expectation, implying that instead of being a renowned comedian, Davro is now merely impersonating another celebrity, Shane Richie, who is also known for his roles in British television, particularly in the soap opera Eastenders. This unexpected shift in focus creates humor through its absurdity and playfulness.

** How it Lands ** 
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with British television and its various personalities. The reference to Shane Richie, a well-known figure in British popular culture, will likely be understood and appreciated by the audience. The humor in this joke relies on the audience's shared knowledge and the unexpected twist, making it a clever and amusing introduction.

The repetitive phrase "he's so lovely" is an exaggerated expression of admiration, which creates a comedic effect through its sincerity and cheesiness. Additionally, the phrase "whatever it's called" when referring to Roy Stride's second single is a tongue-in-cheek remark that pokes fun at the idea that the single might not be well-known or memorable.

# Richard Fleeshman's intro

Richard Fleeshman's introduction is humorous due to its witty remark about his album receiving only one star. The phrase "even his album's got one star" is a clever play on words, referencing both the album's poor review and Richard Fleeshman's status as a former soap star, now attempting to become a pop star. This unexpected twist creates humor through its cleverness and wordplay.

** How it Lands ** 
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who appreciate witty remarks and clever wordplay. The reference to Richard Fleeshman's album receiving only one star is a relatable and amusing commentary on the challenges of transitioning from one field to another.

Bring back Bobby Davro." This unexpected shift in focus creates humor through its absurdity and lighthearted teasing.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 03: Dappy, Keith Chegwin, Tahita Bulmer, Rich Rulche

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Noel's team tonight, the leader of Mercury-nominated New Young Pony Club. She's so cool. None of you squares probably know who she is, but I do, because a researcher told me. It's Tahita Bulmer. 

Also on Noel's team is one of Britain's most loved early morning impromptu doorstep cash prize givers. It's recovering TV presenter, Keith Chegwin. 

Phil's first guest is from urban collective N-Dubz. This year he won a MOBO, which you may say is worthless. However, it does entitle him to a mammoth 20 nectar points and free entry to the Keswick Pencil Museum. It's Dappy, ladies and gentlemen. 

And his second guest is the mighty Bruce Star and friend of Noel Fielding, but that's not why he's here. It's quiz show asset and valid booking, Rich Fulcher.

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Tahita Bulmer's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke that relies on self-deprecation and irony. The host claims to be "cool" because they know who Tahita Bulmer is, but immediately subverts this by revealing that they only know her because "a researcher told me." This humorously undermines the host's attempt to appear cool and in-the-know, implying that they're actually clueless.

The joke also contains a secondary layer of humor, as the host calls the audience "squares" for not knowing who Tahita Bulmer is. This is a lighthearted jab at the audience, implying that they're not as hip or knowledgeable as the host (who, again, only knows Bulmer because of a researcher).

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are probably familiar with the Mercury Prize and the indie music scene. The self-deprecation and irony will likely resonate with viewers who appreciate the host's willingness to poke fun at themselves. The joke's lighthearted and playful tone also makes it accessible to a broader audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

The joke's clever use of self-deprecation and irony makes it amusing, but it may not be laugh-out-loud hilarious for everyone. A comedy writer might appreciate the joke's structure and wordplay, but a casual viewer might just chuckle and move on.

# Keith Chegwin's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke that relies on absurdity and exaggeration. The host describes Keith Chegwin as "one of Britain's most loved early morning impromptu doorstep cash prize givers," which is an obvious overstatement. The humor comes from the unexpected and ridiculous description of Chegwin's profession.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are probably familiar with Chegwin's TV presenting career. The absurdity and exaggeration will likely create a comedic effect, as viewers will recognize the ridiculousness of the description.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

The joke's absurdity and exaggeration make it more likely to elicit a laugh from both casual viewers and comedy writers. The unexpected twist on Chegwin's profession creates a comedic surprise that will likely resonate with audiences.

# Dappy's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke that relies on sarcasm and ridicule. The host describes the MOBO award as "worthless," but then ironically lists two ridiculous "benefits" of winning the award: 20 nectar points and free entry to the Keswick Pencil Museum. The humor comes from the unexpected and absurd "perks" associated with the award.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are probably familiar with the MOBO awards and the concept of nectar points. The sarcasm and ridicule will likely create a comedic effect, as viewers will recognize the absurdity of the "benefits" listed.

Judge Analysis: The model grasped the basic self-deprecation but missed the deeper commentary on music show conventions and industry pretension that the gold standard identified. Its analysis of audience reaction is shallower, focusing on Mercury Prize familiarity rather than the relatable aspect of not knowing the artist. Funniness rating for home audience matches gold, but overrated writer's perspective (4 vs gold's 3).

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 08: Jon McClure, KT Tunstall, Lauren Laverne, Jeremy Edwards

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight... it's award-winning singer-songwriter KT Tunstall. Phil's second guest presents the Culture Show and recently became a mother. Ooh, isn't she highbrow and fertile! What's she going to do next, give birth to the Venus de Milo whilst wearing glasses? It's Lauren Laverne. Bill's first guest is from Sheffield indie electro funk legends Reverend and the Makers. While some pop shows will content themselves with just any old "Maker", we've only gone and got the actual "Reverend"! It's actually Reverend Jon McClure! And finally, it's former Hollyoaks, Holby City, and Rachel Stevens' hunk, now concentrating on solo hunk projects. It's the Incredible Hunk, Jeremy Edwards!

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 21 Episode 05: Kevin Eldon, Patrick Wolf, Irwin Sparkes, Miquita Oliver

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is lead singer with the chart-topping Hoosiers. You may know them from their in no way annoying TV advert which certainly didn't make me want to drill into my own brain and suck out the memories. It's Irwin Sparkes!
Bill's second guest is from critically acclaimed comedies such as Nighty Night, I'm Alan Partridge and who could forget BBC2's Hyperdrive. Nope? 9ish? Thursdays at that woman... Okay, it's Kevin Eldon ladies and gentlemen!
On Phil's team is the visionary, left-field, avant-garde, genre-defying, classically trained singer-songwriter, and he recently called Mika a twat. It's Patrick Wolf!
His second guest is the shining light of Channel 4's popular youth strand T4. She's charmed everyone from Robert De Niro to 50 Cent and she recently called Mika a *bleep* riddled *bleep* basket of a *bleep*! It's my good friend and colleague, Miquita Oliver.

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Irwin Sparkes' intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in this introduction is about the Hoosiers' TV advert being annoying to the point where it makes the host want to "drill into my own brain and suck out the memories." The humour is intended to be ironic and self-deprecating, as the host is acknowledging the advert's annoyance while also introducing the lead singer of the band. The joke relies on the audience's shared experience of finding the advert annoying, and the host's exaggerated reaction is meant to be humorous.

The joke can be broken down into two parts: the setup, which establishes the Hoosiers' TV advert as annoying, and the punchline, which is the host's extreme reaction to it. The use of the phrase "in no way annoying" is a clear example of irony, as it is obvious that the host is being sarcastic. The phrase "drill into my own brain and suck out the memories" is an exaggerated and absurd reaction, which adds to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The audience is likely to be familiar with the Hoosiers' TV advert and can relate to finding it annoying. The joke's use of irony and exaggeration makes it accessible and easy to understand. The joke's tone is also consistent with the show's irreverent and humorous style.

In terms of how funny it is, the joke is likely to elicit a minor exhale out the nose or an audible snort from the audience. The joke is not laugh-out-loud hilarious, but it is a clever and well-crafted joke that is likely to raise a smile.

# Kevin Eldon's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in this introduction is about the show "Hyperdrive" being obscure and unknown. The humour is intended to be ironic and self-deprecating, as the host is acknowledging the show's lack of popularity while also introducing one of its stars. The joke relies on the audience's shared experience of not knowing the show, and the host's awkward attempts to recall its details are meant to be humorous.

The joke in this introduction is about Patrick Wolf being a "visionary, left-field, avant-garde, genre-defying, classically trained singer-songwriter" who also happens to have called Mika a twat. The humour is intended to be ironic and unexpected, as the host is setting up Patrick Wolf as a sophisticated and artistic person, only to subvert that expectation with a crude insult.

The joke relies on the audience's expectation of what a "visionary, left-field, avant-garde, genre-defying, classically trained singer-songwriter" would be like, and the contrast between that expectation and the reality of Patrick Wolf's behaviour is meant to be humorous.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The audience is likely to be familiar with the stereotype of the pretentious artist, and the subversion of that expectation is likely to be humorous. The joke's use of irony and unexpectedness makes it accessible and easy to understand.

In terms of how funny it is, the joke is likely to elicit a laugh-out-loud reaction from the audience. The joke is well-crafted and unexpected, and the contrast between Patrick Wolf's artistic persona and his crude behaviour is likely to be humorous.

# Test Model Analysis

# Ryan Jarman's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on the unexpected twist of comparing Ryan Jarman's coolness to that of other musicians (Craig Finn, Eddie Argos, and Yannis Philippakis) by referencing the NME Cool List. The humor comes from the absurdity of quantifying "coolness" through a list, and the unexpected comparison to other musicians who are likely not as well-known to the general audience. The use of "officially even cooler" adds to the comedic effect, implying that the NME Cool List is an authoritative measure of coolness.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to resonate with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the music industry and the concept of "cool lists." The humor is dry and ironic, which suits the tone of the show. However, the joke may not be laugh-out-loud funny for everyone, as it relies on some knowledge of the music industry and the NME Cool List.

**Funniness Ratings**
* Audience at home: 3 (An audible snort)
* Comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

# David Cross's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke is a play on the idea of a high-profile American celebrity coming to the UK to participate in a panel show, which is often seen as a step down from their usual level of fame. The humor comes from the unexpected twist of saying that Joe Pasquale, a relatively unknown British comedian, could have had the seat instead of David Cross. The joke implies that the show is not prestigious enough to warrant a big-name American celebrity like David Cross.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to be funny to the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the concept of celebrity hierarchies and the idea of panel shows being a step down from more prestigious work. The humor is quick-witted and ironic, which suits the tone of the show.

**Funniness Ratings**
* Audience at home: 4 (LOL)

# Jermaine Jackson's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on the unexpected twist of referencing Jermaine Jackson's brother Randy, implying that the audience might confuse the two. The humor comes from the absurdity of having to clarify which Jackson brother is appearing on the show.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to be mildly amusing to the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the Jackson family and their various celebrity siblings. However, the joke is relatively straightforward and may not be laugh-out-loud funny for everyone.

# Katie Brand's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The joke relies on the unexpected twist of referencing ITV2's policy of producing exclusively low-quality shows, implying that Katie Brand's show is an exception to this rule. The humor comes from the absurdity of a network having a deliberate policy of producing bad content, and the unexpected twist of Katie Brand's show being a lone crusade against this policy.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to be funny to the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the concept of TV networks and their varying levels of quality. The humor is quick-witted and ironic, which suits the tone of the show.

His second guest is the comedy actress formerly known as Jessica Stevenson, who recently married and now wants to be known as Jessica Hynes. It's Jessica Stevenson!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Joel Pott's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke here relies on a bit of wordplay and a tongue-in-cheek comparison. The host describes Joel Pott as the lead singer from "one of those Snow Patrol-style bands," which could be seen as slightly derogatory, as if Athlete is a lesser version of Snow Patrol. This comparison implies that Athlete is just another generic band in the same style, poking fun at the similarity in styles and perhaps even implying a lack of originality.

** How it Lands **
For the typical audience of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks," this joke will likely elicit a minor chuckle. Snow Patrol is a well-known band, and the audience is likely familiar with their style of music. By making this comparison, the host is making a humorous observation that might resonate with the audience. However, the joke is not laugh-out-loud funny, and some viewers might not find it amusing at all.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 2.5 (Between a minor exhale and an audible snort)

# Kimberley Stewart's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke in this introduction relies on a bit of celebrity name-dropping and the contrast between Kimberley Stewart's two claims to fame. The host describes her as "not just Rod Stewart's daughter," which is a legitimate claim to fame, but then adds that she is "also in her own right a friend of Paris Hilton." The humor comes from the implication that being friends with Paris Hilton is somehow a notable achievement or a legitimate claim to fame, which is a tongue-in-cheek commentary on celebrity culture.

** How it Lands **
For the typical audience of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks," this joke will likely elicit a chuckle. The audience is likely familiar with Paris Hilton and the absurdity of celebrity culture, so the joke will resonate with them. The humor is lighthearted and playful, but not laugh-out-loud funny.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Lethal Bizzle's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke here relies on a bit of repetition and absurdity. The host asks "Oi! Who's that boy?" and then answers "Lethal Bizzle!" multiple times, which becomes increasingly ridiculous. The humor also comes from the contrast between the aggressive, streetwise persona of Lethal Bizzle (a rapper) and the host's playful, almost silly introduction.

** How it Lands **
For the typical audience of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks," this joke will likely elicit a laugh. The repetition and absurdity of the introduction create a comedic effect that is hard to resist. The audience is likely familiar with Lethal Bizzle's persona, and the host's playful take on it will be amusing.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4.5 (Between LOL and ROFL)

# Jessica Stevenson's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke here relies on a bit of wordplay and a lighthearted jab at the guest's recent name change. The host describes Jessica Stevenson as "the comedy actress formerly known as Jessica Stevenson," which is a tongue-in-cheek reference to her recent marriage and name change to Jessica Hynes. The humor comes from the absurdity of introducing someone with their former name, as if they are a completely different person.

** How it Lands **
For the typical audience of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks," this joke will likely elicit a chuckle. The audience is likely familiar with Jessica Stevenson's work, and the lighthearted jab at her name change will be amusing. However, the joke is not laugh-out-loud funny, and some viewers might not find it amusing at all.

However, it did correctly identify the humor in the contrast between host delivery and rap culture, and its funniness ratings aligned with the gold standard.

Judge Analysis: The model mischaracterized this as 'wordplay' and missed the core humor of simple defiance identified in the gold response. Its analysis wandered into irrelevant territory about her being 'a completely different person.' However, it did capture some of the basic setup-contradiction structure. Funniness ratings were slightly high but in the right ballpark.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 20 Episode 03: Preston, Anne Charleston, Ed Byrne, Fyfe Dangerfield, and a special guest

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Preston, Bill's first guest is Ordinary Boy and professional celebrity. Preston appeared on "Celebrity Big Brother" and then married the winner, Chantelle. Preston was worried it would alienate hardcore Ordinary Boys fans, but luckily, neither of them were in the country, or existed. Ed Byrne, Bill's second guest, is the voice of the Carphone Warehouse and one of those Irish-style comedians. Ed appeared on "Blind Date" before becoming a comedian. Going on a game show to get on TV and find a wife, imagine the desperation, Preston.  And for Phil's team, GUILLEMOTS lead singer and a lovely man, Fyfe Dangerfield. GUILLEMOTS often start their show by running through the audience, screaming and banging biscuit tins, which is nearly as annoying an opening as hearing the words, "Hello, I'm Katie Melua." Finally, here she is, Bill's second guest. It's only Anne Maddock from Neighbours' Charlene. In 2005, Anne had cosmetic surgery on her neck on the Vanessa Feltz show, "Cosmetic Surgery Live." People with scalpels in the same room as Vanessa, and they slit *your* neck?

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Preston's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on the expectation that a band like Ordinary Boys would have a large and dedicated fan base. However, the punchline subverts this expectation by stating that there are no fans, implying that the band is not popular. The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the clever wordplay.

The second part of the intro, mentioning Preston's marriage to Chantelle, is not a joke in itself but sets up the next joke about Ed Byrne. The comparison between Preston's situation and Ed's appearance on "Blind Date" creates a humorous connection between the two.

**How it Lands**
The joke about Ordinary Boys' non-existent fans might elicit a chuckle from the audience, especially those familiar with the band's relatively low profile. However, the humor is somewhat niche and may not resonate with everyone.

The jab at Preston's marriage and the subsequent comparison with Ed Byrne's "Blind Date" appearance might get a more significant laugh, as it's a lighthearted way to poke fun at the guests.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 3 (An audible snort)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4 (LOL)

# Ed Byrne's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke about Ed being "one of those Irish-style comedians" is a play on stereotypes, but it's not a strong joke. The humor is supposed to come from the unexpected twist on the typical expectation of what an Irish comedian is like, but it falls flat.

The second part of the intro, about Ed appearing on "Blind Date" before becoming a comedian, sets up a joke about desperation. The punchline, "Going on a game show to get on TV and find a wife, imagine the desperation, Preston," is a clever connection between Ed's past and Preston's situation. The humor comes from the witty remark and the unexpected twist.

**How it Lands**
The joke about Ed being an "Irish-style comedian" might get a minor laugh, but it's not a strong joke. The audience might find it mildly amusing, but it's not a memorable or impactful joke.

The joke about Ed's desperation, on the other hand, might get a more significant laugh, especially since it's a clever connection between Ed's past and Preston's situation.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose) for the first joke, 3 (An audible snort) for the second joke
From a comedy writer's perspective: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose) for the first joke, 4 (LOL) for the second joke

# Fyfe Dangerfield's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke about GUILLEMOTS' opening act, running through the audience, screaming and banging biscuit tins, is an exaggeration of the band's energetic performances. The humor comes from the vivid and absurd description.

The comparison with Katie Melua's opening is a joke, implying that GUILLEMOTS' opening is annoying, but Katie Melua's is even more so. The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the clever wordplay.

**How it Lands**
The joke about GUILLEMOTS' opening act might get a chuckle from the audience, especially those familiar with the band's energetic performances. The absurdity of the description adds to the humor.

The comparison with Katie Melua's opening might get a more significant laugh, as it's a clever and unexpected twist.

# Anne Maddock's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke about Anne having cosmetic surgery on her neck on the Vanessa Feltz show, "Cosmetic Surgery Live," is a play on the expectation that the show would be a serious and professional environment. The punchline, "People with scalpels in the same room as Vanessa, and they slit *your* neck?" is a clever and unexpected twist, implying that Vanessa Feltz is so annoying that the surgeons would rather harm the patient than her.

**How it Lands**
The joke might get a significant laugh from the audience, especially since it's a clever and unexpected twist. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation and the clever wordplay.

Judge Analysis: The model misses key aspects of the joke structure, particularly the childlike escalation pattern identified in the gold response. It over-complicates the simple burn by trying to frame it as 'wordplay' when it's a straightforward insult joke. The ratings are too generous, missing the more modest assessment in the gold standard.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 20 Episode 06: Adam Buxton, Mel C, Bonnie Tyler, Krishnan Guru-Murphy

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is former Spice Girl and retired sporting legend, it's Melanie Chisholm. Melanie once branded Cliff Richard's Millennium Prayer a complete pile of shit. 

Phil's second guest is former Adam and Joe sensation, it's funny comedian Adam Buxton. Adam says he gets really starstruck, especially with pop stars: "I want to impress them and be their friend, but I just get tongue-tied." 

Bill's first guest is Welsh woman and loud singer, it's Bonnie Tyler. On a recent flight from France to Mauritius, a group of Belgians complained when, at the request of the co-pilot, Bonnie Tyler sang Total Eclipse of the Heart.

His second guest is saucy Channel 4 News sexpot, it's Krishnan Guru-Murthy. One of Krishnan's news high points was securing an exclusive interview with Mikhail Gorbachev.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Melanie Chisholm's intro
** Intended Humour **
The intended humor in Melanie Chisholm's introduction lies in the unexpected twist of her opinion on Cliff Richard's song "Millennium Prayer." The punchline "Melanie once branded Cliff Richard's Millennium Prayer a complete pile of shit" is a humorous surprise, given the expectation that the Spice Girls were seen as a wholesome, family-friendly pop group. This juxtaposition creates comedic contrast, making the harsh language and blunt criticism more amusing.

The joke also pokes fun at Cliff Richard, who is often seen as a conservative and establishment figure. The humor comes from the idea that Melanie Chisholm, a former Spice Girl, would use such strong language to criticize a song by a well-respected artist like Cliff Richard.

** How it Lands ** 
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with British pop culture and the Spice Girls. The reference to Cliff Richard's song and Melanie's unexpected opinion creates a sense of shared knowledge and cultural context. The humor is also amplified by the host's deadpan delivery, which adds to the comedic effect.

The joke is moderately funny, with the humor coming from the unexpected twist and the contrast between Melanie's wholesome image and her harsh language.

** Funniness Ratings **
Audience: 3 (An audible snort)
Comedy Writer: 4 (LOL)

# Adam Buxton's intro
** Intended Humour **
Adam Buxton's introduction contains a self-deprecating joke about getting starstruck and tongue-tied around pop stars. The intended humor is in the relatable and endearing quality of Adam's confession. The quote "I want to impress them and be their friend, but I just get tongue-tied" is a humorous admission of vulnerability and awkwardness.

The joke also plays on the expectation that a comedian like Adam Buxton would be confident and charismatic, but instead, he reveals a more human and insecure side. This vulnerability creates a comedic connection with the audience.

** How it Lands ** 
The joke is likely to land well with the audience, who can relate to feeling starstruck or awkward around celebrities. Adam's self-deprecating humor is endearing and creates a sense of empathy. The joke is also well-delivered, with a natural and conversational tone that adds to the comedic effect.

The joke is moderately funny, with the humor coming from Adam's vulnerability and relatability.

** Funniness Ratings **
Audience: 3 (An audible snort)
Comedy Writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Bonnie Tyler's intro
** Intended Humour **
Bonnie Tyler's introduction contains a humorous anecdote about singing "Total Eclipse of the Heart" on a flight and annoying a group of Belgian passengers. The intended humor is in the absurdity of the situation and the image of Bonnie Tyler singing her hit song on a plane.

The joke also pokes fun at Bonnie Tyler's reputation as a loud and powerful singer, with the implication that her voice is so overwhelming that it annoyed the other passengers.

** How it Lands ** 
The joke is likely to land well with the audience, who are familiar with Bonnie Tyler's song and her reputation as a powerful singer. The anecdote is amusing and creates a vivid image in the audience's minds. The humor is also amplified by the unexpected twist of the Belgian passengers complaining, which adds to the comedic effect.

# Krishnan Guru-Murthy's intro
** Intended Humour **
Krishnan Guru-Murthy's introduction does not contain a joke. The statement about securing an exclusive interview with Mikhail Gorbachev is a factual statement and a highlight of Krishnan's career as a journalist. The description of Krishnan as a "saucy Channel 4 News sexpot" is a playful and tongue-in-cheek introduction, but it is not a joke in itself.

The tone is lighthearted and humorous, but the statement about the interview is a genuine achievement and not intended to be humorous.

Judge Analysis: The model misses the 'retired sporting legend' joke entirely, which the gold standard identifies as a key element playing on her Sporty Spice persona.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 20 Episode 02: Noel Fielding, Donny Tourette, Philip Olivier, Alfie Jackson

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is Mighty Boosh comedy man and lovely-haired cool dude, Noel Fielding. Noel hates traditional jokes, which is a shame because I was talking to an Englishman, Irishman, and Scotsman the other day, and something particularly funny happened, but you'll never find out, Fielding. His second guest is the Holloways' hip indie frontman, Alfie Jackson. Like the Libertines, the Holloways have two frontmen, but unlike Carl and Pete, Alfie and Rob don't have a highly charged erotic frisson on stage. They just have wonderful sex. 

Phil's first guest is tower of London punk frontman and reality punk TV star, Donny Tourette. Poignantly echoing punk legend Sid Vicious's untimely death from a heroin overdose, Donny Tourette once got thrown off a London bus after refusing to buy a ticket. And to think, the Sex Pistols only sang about anarchy in the UK. This guy's living it, man! Phil's second guest is Hollyoaks in the City star and winner of The Games, Sir Philip Olivier. Philip is known for his toned torso and beefcake physique, but just because he's a big, muscly guy doesn't mean he can't act. That's pure coincidence.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#


# Noel Fielding's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on Noel Fielding's dislike of traditional jokes. The host sets up a familiar joke structure with "I was talking to an Englishman, Irishman, and Scotsman the other day," which is a common setup for a punchline. However, instead of delivering the punchline, the host subverts expectations by saying "but you'll never find out, Fielding," implying that Noel's dislike of traditional jokes means the audience will be deprived of the joke's payoff. This unexpected twist creates humor through the use of irony and anti-climax.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to resonate with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with Noel Fielding's comedic style and his irreverent approach to humor. The joke's lighthearted and playful jab at Noel's preferences adds to its charm. However, the humor may not be laugh-out-loud hilarious, as it relies on a relatively subtle play on expectations.

**Funniness Ratings**
* Audience at home: 3 (An audible snort)

# Alfie Jackson's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke compares the Holloways' frontmen to the Libertines, highlighting the difference in their on-stage dynamics. The punchline "They just have wonderful sex" is a humorous exaggeration, implying that Alfie and Rob have a more straightforward and healthy relationship, unlike the Libertines' Carl and Pete, who were known for their tumultuous and intense relationship.

**How it Lands**
This joke may elicit a chuckle from the audience, particularly those familiar with the Libertines' history. However, the humor is somewhat reliant on knowledge of the specific bands and their dynamics, which might limit its appeal to a broader audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
* Audience at home: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)

# Donny Tourette's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke compares Donny Tourette's rebellious behavior (getting thrown off a bus for not buying a ticket) to the Sex Pistols' iconic song "Anarchy in the UK." The humor comes from the absurdity of equating a relatively mundane act of defiance with the punk rock spirit of anarchy. The punchline "This guy's living it, man!" further emphasizes the ridiculousness of the comparison.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to appeal to the show's audience, who appreciate irreverent humor and are familiar with punk rock's ethos. The joke's clever wordplay and unexpected twist on the concept of anarchy add to its comedic value.

# Philip Olivier's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a clever play on expectations, setting up the idea that Philip Olivier's acting abilities are separate from his physical appearance. The punchline "That's pure coincidence" is a humorous understatement, implying that his acting skills are, in fact, directly related to his physique.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to elicit a chuckle from the audience, particularly those familiar with the stereotype of the "big, muscly guy" being typecast in certain roles. The humor is lighthearted and playful, making it accessible to a broad audience.

Bill's first guest would be the leading comedian of his generation, if it wasn't for that ridiculous hair, it's Alan Davies.  Men want to have a drink with him, women want to sleep with him, and people who've got their mortgages from the Abbey want to punch him in his trustworthy face.

# Alan Davies' intro

**Intended Humour**

This introduction contains multiple jokes. The first joke is about Alan Davies' hair, implying that it's ridiculous and undermines his status as a leading comedian. The humour comes from the unexpected twist on the typical phrase "leading comedian of his generation," which is usually a genuine compliment. The addition of "if it wasn't for that ridiculous hair" adds a layer of irony and playfulness, making the joke lighthearted and teasing.

The second joke is a parody of the typical "men want to be him, women want to be with him" phrase, often used to describe someone who is admired and desirable. The addition of "people who've got their mortgages from the Abbey want to punch him in his trustworthy face" is a clever subversion of this trope. The humour comes from the unexpected twist and the use of the word "trustworthy," which is a quality often associated with banks and financial institutions, but not typically with someone's face. The joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the Abbey bank's advertising campaign, which featured Alan Davies as a trustworthy and relatable figure.

**How it Lands**

Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The audience is familiar with Alan Davies and his comedic style, and the jokes are clever and playful. The use of irony and subversion of expectations adds to the humour, making it more likely to elicit a laugh.

The joke about Alan Davies' hair is a minor joke, but it sets the tone for the rest of the introduction. The second joke is more substantial and relies on the audience's familiarity with the Abbey bank's advertising campaign. The use of the word "trustworthy" adds to the humour, making it a clever and well-crafted joke.

The joke is well-crafted, and the use of irony and subversion of expectations adds to the humour. The audience is likely to appreciate the clever wordplay and the unexpected twist on the typical phrase.

# Chris Peck's intro

**Intended Humour**

This introduction contains a joke about Chris Peck and his band, Boy Kill Boy. The joke is about the band's behaviour in a rented mansion in Ibiza, causing £10,000 worth of damage. However, the punchline is that the damage was not to the physical property but to their "PR credibility." The humour comes from the unexpected twist on the typical story of rockstars causing chaos and destruction. Instead of the usual tale of debauchery, the joke is about the band's reputation being damaged.

**How it Lands**

Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land reasonably well. The audience is familiar with the stereotype of rockstars causing chaos, and the twist on this trope adds to the humour. However, the joke relies on the audience's understanding of the concept of PR credibility, which might not be universally familiar.

The joke is clever and well-crafted, but it might not be as relatable or accessible to a wider audience. The use of the phrase "PR credibility" adds a layer of complexity to the joke, making it more niche.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 06: Lily Allen, Steve Strange, Jamelia, Mark Watson

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is modern pop star and MySpace hussy, Lily Allen. Lily was expelled from five schools. At 14, she ran away to go to Glastonbury and she pushed pills in Ibiza. 

His second guest is 80s pop star and party man, Steve Strange. Steve took part in Celebrity Scissorhands for Children In Need. It was an unusual reality show in that it had no winner, but nine losers.

Bill's first guest is saucy pop minx and fertile mother of two, Jamelia. In 2004, Jamelia wore a £400,000 diamond-encrusted dress to the MOBOs. She almost looked three-quarters of a million dollars.

His second guest is Welsh comedian, Mark Watson. Mark pretends to be Welsh in his act, but he's actually from Bristol.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Lily Allen's intro
** Intended Humour **
Lily Allen's intro contains two elements of intended humour. Firstly, calling her a "MySpace hussy" is a humorous way of describing her rise to fame, especially considering the context of MySpace being a popular social media platform during that time. The word "hussy" has a derogatory connotation, implying Lily is attention-seeking and possibly promiscuous. The joke relies on the unexpected twist on the typical description of a pop star and the slight shock value of using a somewhat risqué term.

The second element of humour comes from the reveal of Lily's troubled past, specifically being expelled from five schools, running away to Glastonbury at 14, and pushing pills in Ibiza. This is presented in a dry and non-judgmental manner, almost as if these are normal or relatable experiences. The humour comes from the unexpected twist on the typical description of a pop star's background, making her seem more rebellious and wild.

** How it Lands **
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well as it is a mix of clever wordplay and unexpected twists on the typical pop star image. The audience will appreciate the quick wit and slight irreverence. However, some viewers might find the use of the term "hussy" to be slightly off-putting or sexist.

In terms of how funny it is, the joke is quite effective. The unexpected twist on the typical description of a pop star and the use of the term "hussy" create a sense of surprise and slight shock, making it more memorable and impactful.

Steve Strange's intro contains one element of intended humour. The joke is about the reality show "Celebrity Scissorhands for Children In Need" having no winner but nine losers.

** How it Lands **
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land moderately well. The audience will appreciate the clever wordplay and the unexpected twist, but the joke might not be laugh-out-loud funny for everyone.

In terms of how funny it is, the joke is somewhat effective. The play on expectations and the dry delivery create a sense of surprise, but the joke might not be as memorable or impactful as some of the other intros.

From the perspective of a comedy writer: 2.5 (Between a minor exhale and an audible snort)

# Jamelia's intro
** Intended Humour **
Jamelia's intro contains one element of intended humour. The joke is about Jamelia wearing a £400,000 diamond-encrusted dress to the MOBOs and almost looking three-quarters of a million dollars. This is a play on the phrase "a million dollars," which is often used to describe someone looking very attractive or impressive. The humour comes from the unexpected twist on the phrase and the clever wordplay.

** How it Lands **
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The audience will appreciate the clever wordplay and the unexpected twist, and the joke is likely to elicit a laugh.

# Mark Watson's intro
** Intended Humour **
Mark Watson's intro contains one element of intended humour. The joke is about Mark pretending to be Welsh in his act but actually being from Bristol. This is a play on the expectation of a comedian's authenticity and the stereotype of Welsh people. The humour comes from the unexpected twist and the dry delivery of the punchline.

** How it Lands **
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land moderately well. The audience will appreciate the clever wordplay and the unexpected twist, but the joke might not be laugh-out-loud funny for everyone.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 07: Christmas Special - David Gest, Jenni Falconer, Dan Gillespie Sells, Danny Jones

#----------------------#
# Intro Text

Bill's first guest is the funky regional McFly hunk, Danny Jones! 

Phill's first guest is the Feeling frontman and all-round respectable booking, it's Dan Gillespie Sells!

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Danny Jones' intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The intended humor comes from the description of Danny Jones as a "funky regional McFly hunk." The word "regional" is added to poke fun at McFly's perceived lack of international fame or appeal, implying that they are only popular in certain regions of the UK. The phrase "funky regional" is also an oxymoron, as "regional" is not typically associated with something being "funky" (i.e., exciting or trendy). This contrast between the two words creates a comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to resonate with viewers who are familiar with McFly and their reputation as a UK-based pop-rock band. The joke relies on a certain level of shared knowledge and cultural context, which might not be immediately clear to international viewers. However, for the target audience, the joke is likely to elicit a chuckle due to its lighthearted and playful nature.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (An audible snort)

# Dan Gillespie Sells' intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction does not contain a joke. The description of Dan Gillespie Sells as "the Feeling frontman and all-round respectable booking" is a genuine and factual introduction, without any apparent attempt at humor.

**Why it's not a joke**
This introduction is purely informational, providing context about Dan Gillespie Sells' profession and his role as a guest on the show. There is no apparent wordplay, irony, or unexpected twist that would suggest an attempt at humor.

# Jenni Falconer's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The intended humor comes from the description of Jenni Falconer as "GMTV's celebrity honey-trap and Scotland's answer to Lorraine Kelly." The phrase "celebrity honey-trap" is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Falconer's reputation as a charming and attractive television presenter, implying that she is capable of luring in celebrities with her charm. The comparison to Lorraine Kelly, a well-known Scottish television presenter, is also humorous, as it implies that Falconer is a Scottish equivalent, but with a more provocative edge.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to resonate with viewers who are familiar with GMTV and Lorraine Kelly. The joke relies on a certain level of shared knowledge and cultural context, which might not be immediately clear to international viewers. However, for the target audience, the joke is likely to elicit a chuckle due to its lighthearted and playful nature.

# David Gest's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The intended humor comes from the description of David Gest as a "saucy funny-haired jungle stunner." The phrase "saucy funny-haired" is a humorous and exaggerated description of Gest's appearance, implying that he is a charming and attractive individual. The word "jungle" is also added, likely referencing Gest's appearance on the reality TV show "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!", which adds to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to resonate with viewers who are familiar with David Gest and his reputation as a charismatic and flamboyant individual. The joke relies on a certain level of shared knowledge and cultural context, which might not be immediately clear to international viewers. However, for the target audience, the joke is likely to elicit a chuckle due to its lighthearted and playful nature.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

The addition of "David-reassuringly-expensive-Gest" at the end of the introduction is also a joke, as it pokes fun at Gest's reputation for being flashy and extravagant. This added joke is likely to increase the overall comedic effect of the introduction.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 06: Lauren Laverne, Tom Robinson, Math Priest, Jeff Green

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
- Phil's first guest, it's Matt Priest of Dodgy. Matt's such a legendary ligger that he was once unable to appear on this show, because he'd already accepted an invitation to the launch of the PG Tips triangular bag.
- Phil's other guest is Tom Robinson, one of the finest pop writers to come out of punk. One of Tom's early hits was "Glad to Be Gay." 
- Sean's first guest, Lauren Laverne, singer with Sunderland's indie All Saints, Kenickie.
- Sean's other guest is Jeff Green, of TV and stand-up comedy fame. Jeff's been described in the press as a cheeky cherub, at least that's what he told the police when he was arrested on Hampstead Heath stark naked and holding a bow and arrow.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Matt Priest's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke that aims to poke fun at Matt Priest's reputation as a "legendary ligger" (a term used to describe someone who frequently attends parties and social events). The punchline about him being unable to appear on the show because he had already accepted an invitation to the launch of the PG Tips triangular bag is a humorous exaggeration of his social calendar. The joke relies on the unexpected twist of Matt prioritizing a seemingly mundane event (the launch of a tea bag packaging) over a TV show appearance, which adds to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with British pop culture and the concept of a "ligger," this joke might elicit a chuckle. The humor is lighthearted and playful, making fun of Matt's socialite reputation without being mean-spirited. However, the joke might not be laugh-out-loud hilarious, as it's a relatively subtle and quick-witted remark.

# Jeff Green's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke that aims to poke fun at Jeff Green's mischievous reputation. The punchline about him being described in the press as a "cheeky cherub" and using this phrase to explain his arrest on Hampstead Heath while naked and holding a bow and arrow is a humorous exaggeration of his antics. The joke relies on the unexpected twist of Jeff using a wholesome descriptor ("cheeky cherub") to downplay a scandalous situation, which adds to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with British comedy and the concept of a "cheeky" persona, this joke might elicit a laugh. The humor is playful and irreverent, making fun of Jeff's reputation without being mean-spirited. The joke has a good chance of landing well, as it's a clever and unexpected twist on a typical celebrity introduction.

Judge Analysis: The model grasped the basic concept of the ligger joke but missed the key comedic element of choosing a mundane tea bag launch over TV. While it noted the 'unexpected twist', it didn't fully explore why the specificity of 'triangular bag' enhances the humor. Theory of mind was decent but missed why this would particularly resonate with British audiences.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 01: Anthea Turner, Alesha Dixon, Phil Nicol, Ricky Ross

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is former Misteeq star, now a solo artist and FHM's 98th sexiest woman of 2002, it's Alesha. Alesha's mum is a hairdresser and used to run the Misteeq fan club, giving her just 22 hours a day for hairdressing and two hours for lunch. His second guest is surely not Blue Peter, GMTV, Lottery and Wish You Were Here legend, Anthea Turner. Yes it is, it's Anthea Turner. Anthea has made a TV comeback with her BBC3 series, The Perfect Housewife. So now we can say Anthea Turner's washed up. In the nicer, slightly less accurate way. Bill's first guest is the front man of stadium filling Scottish rockers, Deacon Blue, it's Ricky Ross. Lorraine from Deacon Blue has a recurring nightmare where the band are playing to a baying crowd without the correct instruments. I have a recurring nightmare that I'm stuck in the middle of a baying crowd watching Deacon Blue. Only joking, I've never heard of you. Bill's second guest is the winner of this year's Edinburgh Festival Comedy Award, it's funny man, Phil Nichol. Phil plays the producer on a fictional TV panel show whose main joke is they can't get any decent guests. Oh the irony.

# Test Model Analysis

# Alesha's intro
**Intended Humour**
Alesha's introduction contains a joke that relies on wordplay and exaggeration. The punchline "giving her just 22 hours a day for hairdressing and two hours for lunch" is an obvious impossibility, as there are only 24 hours in a day. The joke works by setting up the expectation that Alesha's mum, as a hairdresser and fan club manager, would have a busy schedule. However, the punchline subverts this expectation by implying that she has an impossibly large amount of time for hairdressing, leaving only two hours for lunch. This absurdity creates humor.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, which is likely familiar with British pop culture and humor, this joke should land relatively well. The joke is lighthearted and doesn't rely on complex references or inside knowledge. However, the humor may not be laugh-out-loud funny for everyone, as it's a relatively simple joke. The audience may appreciate the wordplay and exaggeration, but it may not be memorable or impactful.

# Anthea Turner's intro
**Intended Humour**
Anthea Turner's introduction contains two jokes. The first joke is a play on expectations, setting up the idea that the show would not feature Anthea Turner, only to reveal that it is indeed her. This joke works by creating a sense of surprise and incongruity. The second joke, "So now we can say Anthea Turner's washed up. In the nicer, slightly less accurate way," is a clever quip that relies on wordplay and sarcasm. The joke works by implying that Anthea Turner's TV comeback is not a genuine success, but rather a desperate attempt to revive her career.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, which is likely familiar with British TV personalities and humor, these jokes should land relatively well. The first joke is a clever play on expectations, and the second joke is a witty remark that pokes fun at Anthea Turner's career. However, the humor may not be laugh-out-loud funny for everyone, as it relies on some knowledge of Anthea Turner's TV career and the British TV landscape.

# Ricky Ross's intro
**Intended Humour**
Ricky Ross's introduction contains two jokes. The first joke, "Lorraine from Deacon Blue has a recurring nightmare where the band are playing to a baying crowd without the correct instruments," sets up a expectation that the punchline will be a typical nightmare scenario. However, the second joke, "I have a recurring nightmare that I'm stuck in the middle of a baying crowd watching Deacon Blue. Only joking, I've never heard of you," subverts this expectation by implying that the nightmare is not the band's situation, but rather being forced to watch them. This joke works by creating a sense of surprise and mocking the band's relative obscurity.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, which is likely familiar with British music and humor, these jokes should land relatively well. The first joke is a clever setup, and the second joke is a witty remark that pokes fun at Deacon Blue's lack of fame. However, the humor may not be laugh-out-loud funny for everyone, as it relies on some knowledge of Deacon Blue's music and the British music landscape.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 05: John Barrowman, Kelli Young, Daniel Bedingfield, Robin Ince

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Bill's first guest is the star of sci-fi hit drama Torchwood and practicing homosexual, John Barrowman. His second guest is Liberty X songstress, Kelli Young. Kelli's last single stormed into the top 48.

Phill's first guest is pop star and tormented genius, Daniel Bedingfield. Phill's second guest is music loving comedian, writer and broadcaster, Robin Ince.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# John Barrowman's Intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended joke here lies in the contrast and unexpected twist of highlighting John Barrowman's personal life ("practicing homosexual") right after mentioning his professional achievement as the star of Torchwood. This sudden shift from a professional credential to a rather private, and perhaps unnecessary, personal detail is meant to surprise the audience and elicit a laugh.

The phrase "practicing homosexual" itself might be intended to be humorous, as it's an unusual way to describe someone's sexual orientation, implying a level of diligence or dedication to being gay. The word "practicing" often has connotations of effort or improvement, which might add to the comedic effect.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, which is likely open-minded and accustomed to irreverent humor, this joke might elicit a chuckle. However, it's worth noting that humor about someone's personal life and identity can be sensitive and not everyone might find it amusing.

From a comedic perspective, the joke's effectiveness relies on the unexpected twist and the unusual phrasing, which creates a bit of surprise and might elicit a laugh. However, the humor is somewhat reliant on the audience being comfortable with the topic and not finding it off-putting.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 3 (An audible snort)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 3 (An audible snort)

# Kelli Young's Intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke here lies in the phrase "stormed into the top 48", which is an exaggerated and ironic way to describe a song's modest chart success. The word "stormed" implies a dramatic and powerful entry, which is humorous given the relatively low ranking of 48.

**How it Lands**
This type of humor, poking fun at the music industry and the tendency to exaggerate success, is likely to resonate with the show's audience. The joke is lighthearted and playful, making it an easy laugh.

From a comedic perspective, the joke is well-crafted, as it uses a clever play on words to create humor. The irony and exaggeration are clear, making it a relatable and amusing joke.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 19 Episode 02: Will Smith, Paul Young, Matt Willis, Vanessa Feltz

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil’s first guest is the TV presenter of the moment, Vanessa Feltz. 
In 2004, Vanessa hosted Cosmetic Surgery Live on Channel 5, which is the only show to feature live anal bleaching – unless we have a draw tonight and have to go to a tiebreak.
Phil’s second guest is former Busted star, now solo star, certain to make it, it’s Matt Willis.
Last year, Matt Willis checked into the Priory to treat his alcohol problem. After two weeks in therapy, he finally found the emotional strength to stand up and say, 'My name is Matt Willis, and I have an album out.' 

Bill’s first guest is an 80s star who's still very famous and relevant today, it’s Paul Young.
Paul has refused to write songs for Britney Spears, because he said she lacked credibility – as he walked off the set of Celebrity MasterChef after his cook-off with Timmy Mallett.
Bill’s second guest is hugely well-known funny comedian, Will Smith.
Okay, we don’t make a lot of mistakes on this show, but we’ve clearly booked the wrong Will Smith. Even worse than that, we’ve booked THE right Vanessa Feltz.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Vanessa Feltz's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on the phrase "unless we have a draw tonight and have to go to a tiebreak," which is a common phrase used in game shows. However, in this context, it's used to make a humorous connection between the tiebreak and the live anal bleaching featured on Vanessa's show, Cosmetic Surgery Live. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the usual meaning of the phrase and the shock value of referencing a provocative topic like anal bleaching.

**How it Lands**
The joke might elicit a mix of reactions from the audience. Some might find it funny due to the unexpected twist, while others might be taken aback by the reference to anal bleaching. Considering the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the program's irreverent humor, the joke might land relatively well. However, the humor is somewhat reliant on the shock value, which might not appeal to everyone.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 3 (An audible snort)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 2.5 (Between a minor exhale and an audible snort)

# Matt Willis's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke is a play on the typical format of an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting, where members introduce themselves and acknowledge their addiction. In this case, Matt Willis stands up and says, "My name is Matt Willis, and I have an album out." The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the usual AA introduction, implying that Matt's "addiction" is actually his desire to promote his album.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it's a clever play on a familiar format. The humor is well-crafted, and the punchline is unexpected yet makes sense in the context of the setup. The joke doesn't rely on shock value or complex references, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4.5 (Between LOL and ROFL)

# Paul Young's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke is a play on Paul Young's statement about Britney Spears lacking credibility. The humor comes from the fact that Paul Young himself is shown to be lacking credibility by walking off the set of Celebrity MasterChef after a cook-off with Timmy Mallett. The joke is a lighthearted way of poking fun at Paul Young's hypocrisy.

**How it Lands**
This joke might not land as well as the previous ones, as it relies on the audience being familiar with Paul Young's statement about Britney Spears and the context of Celebrity MasterChef. The joke is not as cleverly crafted as the previous ones, and the humor might not be as relatable to the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 2.5 (Between a minor exhale and an audible snort)

# Will Smith's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke is a play on the expectation that the show has booked the famous actor Will Smith, but instead, they've booked a different person with the same name. The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the acknowledgment of the mistake. The additional humor comes from the comparison with Vanessa Feltz, implying that booking the "wrong" Will Smith is not as bad as booking the "right" Vanessa Feltz.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience, as it's a lighthearted way of poking fun at the show's mistake. The humor is well-crafted, and the punchline is unexpected yet makes sense in the context of the setup.

Judge Analysis: The model misses the core comedic strength of connecting a taboo TV moment to the show's format. It over-focuses on wordplay rather than recognizing the shock value and clever format connection highlighted in the gold response.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 05: Rick Witter, Mark Owen, Richard Morton, Shovell

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team tonight is Rick Witter, lead singer from Yorkshire's top indie combo, Shed Seven. Shed Seven were recently told they are absolutely huge in Thailand, but then I bet the bar girls say that to all the customers.

Phil's second guest is Shovell, top thumper with megastars M-People. Shovell used to be a builder, which caused problems at the band's early gigs; he kept sitting on the lighting rig above Heather Small shouting, "Hello darling, wanna go on me bongos?" 

Sean's first guest is Mark Owen, ex of Take That and pop's cuddliest boy next door. Take That once agreed to do a national tour on behalf of the Family Planning Association, to promote safe sex, but they pulled out at the last minute.

Sean's other guest is Richard Morton, stand-up comedy's only guitar-toting Geordie. He's been described as the most effeminate man in Newcastle; in the recent freezing weather, he was spotted on a street corner wearing a long-sleeved t-shirt.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Rick Witter's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on words, using the phrase "absolutely huge in Thailand" in a double sense. The initial meaning implies that Shed Seven is extremely popular in Thailand, but the punchline subverts this by suggesting that the bar girls might say this to all customers, implying a different kind of "huge" (i.e., a reference to the size of a man's genitalia). The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the use of a stereotype about bar girls in Thailand.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to elicit a chuckle from the audience, as it's a lighthearted and playful jab at the band's supposed popularity. The use of a stereotype about bar girls might be seen as slightly off-color, but in the context of the show, it's likely to be viewed as a harmless joke. The audience will appreciate the quick wit and wordplay.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 3 (An audible snort)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 3 (An audible snort)

# Shovell's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke is a play on Shovell's past occupation as a builder and his current role as a musician. The humor comes from the unexpected juxtaposition of a builder's behavior (sitting on a lighting rig) with a musician's behavior (shouting a suggestive comment). The use of the phrase "Hello darling, wanna go on me bongos?" is a clever and humorous way to highlight the contrast between Shovell's old and new careers.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to get a bigger laugh from the audience, as it's a more absurd and unexpected punchline. The use of a silly phrase like "wanna go on me bongos?" adds to the humor, making it a more memorable and quotable joke.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4 (LOL)

# Mark Owen's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on expectations, setting up the idea that Take That is promoting safe sex, only to subvert it by saying they "pulled out" at the last minute. The humor comes from the double meaning of "pulled out," implying both that the band cancelled their participation and that they, ahem, withdrew from a sexual encounter.

**How it Lands**
The joke might elicit a smaller laugh from the audience, as it's a more subtle play on words. The use of a clever double meaning is likely to be appreciated, but the joke might not be as memorable or impactful as some of the other intros.

**Funniness Ratings**

# Richard Morton's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke relies on a play on expectations, setting up the idea that Richard Morton is effeminate, only to subvert it by saying he was spotted wearing a long-sleeved t-shirt in cold weather. The humor comes from the unexpected twist, implying that Morton's effeminacy is so extreme that he's still wearing a relatively light article of clothing in freezing weather.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to get a chuckle from the audience, as it's a lighthearted and playful jab at Morton's supposed effeminacy. The use of a clever twist and a relatable scenario (wearing light clothing in cold weather) adds to the humor.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 07: Mary Ann Hobbs, Justin Currie, Billy Bragg, Jonathan Ross

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Justin Currie, frontman for Del Amitri. Del Amitri have a reputation for being one of rock's most miserable bands. In fact, when they supported The Smiths in 1985, Morrissey used to have to cheer them up with his tickling stick. And it's a warm welcome back for Sean's other guest, the boy balladeer from Barking, Billy Bragg. Billy Bragg was once in the army but lasted for just 90 days, making his the least convincing military career since Colonel Sanders. 

Phil's first guest is Mary Anne Hobbs, rising DJ at Radio 1. Mary Anne's a woman who needs no introduction because, being a Radio 1 DJ, she'd only talk over it anyway. Phil's second guest - oh no, he's back again, it's Jonathan Ross. Jonathan's well known for his love of obscure low-budget trash and incidentally, this is his fourth appearance on the show.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Justin Currie's intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Justin Currie's intro comes from two jokes. The first joke relies on exaggeration and wordplay, describing Del Amitri as "one of rock's most miserable bands." This sets the stage for the punchline, which claims that even Morrissey, infamous for his melancholy persona, had to cheer them up. The use of the "tickling stick" as a prop adds a whimsical, absurd touch to the joke, emphasizing the extent of Del Amitri's misery.

The second joke in Justin Currie's intro is not about him, but rather serves as a transition to Billy Bragg's introduction.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, familiar with British music and culture, this joke likely resonates well. The reference to Morrissey and The Smiths provides a clear context for the joke, and the unexpected twist of Morrissey using a "tickling stick" to cheer them up creates a comedic surprise. The joke's reliance on wordplay and exaggeration makes it amusing and lighthearted.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 3.5 (between an audible snort and LOL)

# Billy Bragg's intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Billy Bragg's intro comes from a joke comparing his short military career to that of Colonel Sanders. The joke relies on the unexpected twist of using a well-known figure like Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, as a benchmark for a failed military career. The humour comes from the absurdity of comparing a musician's military stint to that of a fast-food entrepreneur.

**How it Lands**
This joke likely lands well with the audience, as it's a clever and unexpected comparison. The use of Colonel Sanders as a cultural reference point adds to the joke's relatability and surprise. However, the joke's impact might be slightly diminished by the fact that it's a relatively simple comparison, rather than a complex or layered joke.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 3.5 (between an audible snort and LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 3 (an audible snort)

# Mary Anne Hobbs' intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Mary Anne Hobbs' intro comes from a joke about Radio 1 DJs talking over introductions. The joke relies on the stereotype that Radio 1 DJs are prone to interrupting or talking over others, and the punchline subverts the expectation of a traditional introduction by embracing this trait.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's audience is likely familiar with British radio culture, this joke probably resonates well. The joke's cleverness lies in its self-aware, meta approach to introductions, and the unexpected twist of embracing the stereotype rather than trying to provide a traditional introduction.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4 (LOL)

# Jonathan Ross' intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Jonathan Ross' intro comes from a joke about his love of "obscure low-budget trash" being related to his multiple appearances on the show. The joke relies on a clever connection between Jonathan Ross' personal preferences and the show's perceived quality or reputation.

**How it Lands**
This joke likely lands well with the audience, as it's a lighthearted and playful jab at the show itself. The joke's impact is enhanced by the fact that it's a self-deprecating comment, made at the expense of the show rather than Jonathan Ross himself.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 04: Zoë Ball, Louis Eliot, Graham Norton, Keith Duffy

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil’s team, it’s Louie Eliot, singer with top 20 hipsters and media darlings Rialto. According to Rialto, whenever they want to say something dim they break into a Liam Gallagher impression. Whenever Liam Gallagher wants to say something dim, he just opens his mouth.

Phil’s second guest is Zoe Ball. Zoe joined the Big Breakfast after Chris Evans left. On her first day, she broke an expensive prop intended for a stupid stunt, but he'd left the week before. 

Sean’s first guest is Boyzone’s Keith Duffy. While on tour in Japan, the boy's had voodoo dolls left in their hotel rooms with broken glass in them and the message "You Will Die", P.S. can I have an autograph for my sister?

Sean’s other guest is comedian and television presenter Graham Norton. Amazingly Graham won an award for being the best presenter on the Jack Docherty Show - narrowly beating  Jack Docherty. He's already tipped to win the award for best captain of Sean's team.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Louie Eliot's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke that revolves around a comparison between Rialto and Liam Gallagher. The joke starts by stating that Rialto breaks into a Liam Gallagher impression whenever they want to say something dim. This setup is humorous because it pokes fun at Liam Gallagher's stereotype as not being the most articulate or intelligent person. The punchline, "Whenever Liam Gallagher wants to say something dim, he just opens his mouth," takes this joke to the next level by implying that Liam Gallagher doesn't need to put in any effort to say something dim-witted, as it's just his natural state. This is an example of a " callback" in comedy, where the initial statement is turned on its head and amplified in the punchline.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The audience for Never Mind the Buzzcocks is probably familiar with the Britpop scene and the stereotypes surrounding Liam Gallagher. The joke relies on this shared cultural knowledge, making it more relatable and accessible to the audience. The joke's clever wordplay and unexpected twist also contribute to its humor.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4 (LOL)

# Zoe Ball's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke that centers around Zoe Ball's first day on the Big Breakfast. The joke states that she broke an expensive prop intended for a stupid stunt, but the punchline is that Chris Evans, the person responsible for the stunt, had already left the show. This joke relies on a bit of wordplay and misdirection. The setup makes the audience expect that Zoe Ball broke the prop during a live broadcast or while attempting the stunt, but the punchline subverts this expectation by revealing that the prop was broken before it could even be used.

**How it Lands**
This joke might not land as well as the previous one. The audience needs to be familiar with the Big Breakfast and Chris Evans' departure from the show, which might not be the case for everyone. Additionally, the joke's wordplay and misdirection might not be as clever or unexpected as the previous joke.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 2.5 (A minor exhale out the nose, with some audience members possibly not getting the reference)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 3 (An audible snort, appreciating the joke's mechanics)

# Keith Duffy's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke that revolves around a threatening message left in Boyzone's hotel rooms. The joke starts by setting up a menacing scenario, with voodoo dolls and broken glass, but the punchline "P.S. can I have an autograph for my sister?" completely deflates the tension. This joke relies on the unexpected twist and the absurdity of the request. The contrast between the threatening message and the polite request for an autograph creates humor.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the audience. The unexpected twist and the absurdity of the request make it humorous and relatable. The joke doesn't require any specific knowledge of Boyzone or their music, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4.5 (almost ROFL, appreciating the joke's cleverness and unexpected twist)

# Graham Norton's intro
**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains two jokes. The first joke is about Graham Norton winning an award for being the best presenter on the Jack Docherty Show, narrowly beating Jack Docherty. This joke relies on the absurdity of an award being given for a show where the main presenter is the only one who could potentially win it. The second joke is about Graham Norton being tipped to win the award for best captain of Sean's team, which is a clever callback to the first joke.

**How it Lands**
Both jokes are likely to land well with the audience. The first joke's absurdity and the second joke's clever callback make them humorous and relatable. The audience is likely to appreciate the quick wit and clever wordplay.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL) for both jokes
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4.5 (almost ROFL) for both jokes, appreciating the jokes' cleverness and mechanics

# Intro Text
#----------------------#
On Phil's team, Yorkshire's own Tony Wright of the top ten metal band, Terrorvision. Terrorvision's gigs have been described as a laugh, joke, and a crate of ale, just like a night out with Chris Evans, only with a laugh and the joke. 

Phil's second guest is Toyah Willcox, pop star, Good Sex Guide presenter, and the voice of the Teletubbies. She spends the day saying things like, let's play with Tinky Winky, eh-oh, and again, and again, and again. And after The Good Sex Guide, she does Teletubbies.

On Sean's team, the first guest is Tim Booth from international student favorites, James. When the band played their biggest hit, Sit Down, the audience would respond by sitting down on the floor, which was fine until the Glastonbury Festival when 500 people drowned in three feet of mud.

Sean's other guest is laconic stand-up, John Moloney. John is a favorite with the critics and was recently described in Time Out as "Man, 30, non-smoker, seeks woman any age for physical relationship."

# Tony Wright's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke works by drawing an unexpected comparison between a night out with Chris Evans and a Terrorvision gig. The punchline relies on the audience's prior knowledge of Chris Evans, who, at the time, was infamous for being an excessive drinker and party animal. By adding "only with a laugh and the joke," the introduction implies that Chris Evans' nights out lack the enjoyable aspects (laughter and jokes) that Terrorvision's gigs offer. This contrast creates humor through its clever twist on the audience's expectations.

** How it Lands **
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke would likely resonate with viewers who are familiar with Chris Evans' reputation. The joke's effectiveness relies on this shared cultural knowledge, making it more relatable and amusing to the audience. The joke is funny because it takes an unexpected turn and creates a clever comparison that pokes fun at Chris Evans' party image.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL)
From a comedy writer's perspective: 4 (LOL)

# Toyah Willcox's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke in Toyah Willcox's introduction relies on the unexpected connection between her work on The Good Sex Guide and her role as the voice of the Teletubbies. The punchline, "And after The Good Sex Guide, she does Teletubbies," implies that her work on the children's show is an ironic follow-up to her more adult-oriented content. This contrast creates humor through its clever juxtaposition of Toyah's two seemingly disparate roles.

** How it Lands **
This joke would likely land well with the audience, as it plays on the unexpected combination of Toyah's two jobs. The joke is funny because it creates a humorous connection between two things that wouldn't normally be associated with each other. The use of the phrase "And after The Good Sex Guide" adds to the comedic effect, as it implies a causal link between the two roles.

# Tim Booth's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke in Tim Booth's introduction relies on the unexpected twist on the typical audience response to James' hit song, Sit Down. The punchline, "which was fine until the Glastonbury Festival when 500 people drowned in three feet of mud," takes an initially harmless scenario (audiences sitting down) and turns it into a disastrous and absurd situation. This creates humor through its clever exaggeration and unexpected turn of events.

** How it Lands **
This joke would likely land well with the audience, as it creates a humorous and unexpected twist on a familiar scenario. The joke is funny because it takes an initially harmless situation and turns it into something ridiculous and catastrophic. The use of the phrase "three feet of mud" adds to the comedic effect, as it emphasizes the absurdity of the situation.

# John Moloney's intro
** Intended Humour **
The joke in John Moloney's introduction relies on the unexpected twist on a typical personal ad. The punchline, "Man, 30, non-smoker, seeks woman any age for physical relationship," is a clever play on the usual format of personal ads, which often specify a desired age range for the partner. By making John's ad seem like a genuine, yet humorous, personal ad, the introduction creates humor through its clever subversion of expectations.

** How it Lands **
This joke would likely land well with the audience, as it creates a humorous and unexpected twist on a familiar format. The joke is funny because it takes an initially straightforward scenario (a personal ad) and turns it into something ridiculous and humorous. The use of the phrase "any age" adds to the comedic effect, as it emphasizes the absurdity of the ad.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 03 Episode 02: Mani, Rick McMurray, Lemmy, Richard Fairbrass

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is Rick McMurray from chart-toppers Ash. The band wrote their number one album while still at school. They also wrote a brilliant follow-up but claimed the dog ate it.

Phil's second guest is Lemmy, the main man with heavy metal mothers Motorhead. Lemmy's very proud that his band has been going ten years longer than the Third Reich, and funnily enough, they've also done more damage to Coventry. 

Sean's first guest is Mani, bassist with the mighty Primal Scream. Mani's previous band, the Stone Roses, went on a drunken rampage in their record company's offices, which cost tens of thousands of pounds. They rang accountants who commissioned another Chesney Hawkes album.

Sean's other guest, yes he's young, gifted and back, Richard Fairbrass. Richard says, "Although I'm predominantly gay, I reserve the right to wake up with a big pair of tits," which is no way to talk about the other members of Right Said Fred.

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Rick McMurray's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in this introduction is the claim that Ash wrote a brilliant follow-up album, but "the dog ate it." This is a play on the common excuse that students use when they fail to complete their homework, blaming it on their pet dog. The humor comes from the unexpected application of this childish excuse to a professional music band, implying that they are making a ridiculous and unconvincing claim.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to elicit a chuckle from the audience, particularly those familiar with the common excuse. The show's typical audience, who are likely music fans and familiar with the band Ash, will appreciate the lighthearted poke at the band's expense. The joke is not laugh-out-loud hilarious, but it sets a playful tone for the show.

**Funniness Ratings**
* Audience: 3 (an audible snort)
* Comedy writer: 2 (a minor exhale out the nose)

# Lemmy's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains two jokes. The first joke is the comparison between Motorhead's longevity and the Third Reich's, implying that Motorhead has been a more enduring and successful entity. The humor comes from the unexpected and irreverent comparison between a rock band and a notorious historical regime. The second joke is the claim that Motorhead has done more damage to Coventry than the Third Reich, which is a play on the common perception of rock bands as destructive and chaotic.

**How it Lands**
Both jokes are likely to land well with the audience, particularly those familiar with Motorhead's reputation as a loud and energetic band. The first joke is a clever play on history, while the second joke is a more straightforward exaggeration of the band's destructive tendencies. The show's typical audience will appreciate the irreverent humor and the poke at Coventry's expense.

**Funniness Ratings**
* Audience: 4 (LOL)
* Comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

# Mani's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in this introduction is the claim that the Stone Roses' drunken rampage in their record company's offices led to the commissioning of another Chesney Hawkes album. The humor comes from the unexpected and absurd consequence of the band's actions, implying that their destructive behavior had a direct impact on the music industry.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to elicit a laugh from the audience, particularly those familiar with the Stone Roses' reputation as a rebellious and unpredictable band. The joke is a clever play on the music industry's tendency to produce unexpected and sometimes inexplicable outcomes. The show's typical audience will appreciate the absurdity and creativity of the joke.

**Funniness Ratings**
* Audience: 4 (LOL)
* Comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

# Richard Fairbrass's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in this introduction is Richard's quote about waking up with a "big pair of tits," which is then subverted by the punchline that he is referring to the other members of Right Said Fred. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical expectation of the phrase, implying that Richard is making a humorous comment about his bandmates rather than a lewd remark.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to elicit a laugh from the audience, particularly those familiar with Right Said Fred's campy and irreverent style. The joke is a clever play on words, and the unexpected twist adds to the humor. The show's typical audience will appreciate the lighthearted and playful joke.

**Intended Humour**
Andrew Roachford's introduction does not contain a joke. The phrase "classic Brit soul combo, Roachford" is purely informational and serves to inform the audience of Andrew Roachford's background and association with the band. There's no apparent attempt at humor or wordplay in this introduction.

# Cerys Matthews' intro

**Intended Humour**
Cerys Matthews' introduction contains a joke, with the intended humor coming from the phrase "hard-drinking, hard-singing, and hard-pronouncing." This joke works by setting up a pattern of expectations with "hard-drinking" and "hard-singing," which are common descriptions for rockstars. However, "hard-pronouncing" is an unexpected twist that subverts the typical pattern and adds a layer of humor. The wordplay is likely intended to poke fun at Cerys Matthews' Welsh accent or the perceived difficulty in pronouncing her name, which is a common comedic device used to create humor.

**How it Lands**
Given the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The wordplay on "hard-pronouncing" is clever, and the quick, unexpected twist adds to the comedic effect. The audience familiar with Cerys Matthews and her accent will find the joke amusing and relatable. However, the joke's effectiveness might be limited by its reliance on prior knowledge of Cerys Matthews' accent or name.

**Funniness Ratings**
Considering the intended humor and the audience's expected reaction:

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 08: Merry Mind the Buzzcocks Christmas Special - Boy George, Noddy Holder, Louise Wener, Jonathan Ross

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is Slade's frontman, glam rock godfather, Noddy Holder. He's had no fewer than eight Christmas hits with the same song. Phil's second guest is feisty queen of Britpop and singer from Sleeper, Louise Wener. The band's new album features a photo of Louise as a weedy nine-year-old with gimpy clothes and glasses. Phil's team ends with television host Jonathan Ross, who made his first-ever TV appearance with a walk-on part in Dad's Army and is surprisingly still alive.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Noddy Holder's intro
** Intended Humour **
The intended joke here is about Noddy Holder having "no fewer than eight Christmas hits with the same song." This is a reference to Slade's song "Merry Xmas Everybody," which has been a Christmas staple in the UK since its release in 1973 and has indeed been re-released several times, allowing it to chart multiple times. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on what it means to have multiple hits – instead of having eight different songs that were hits, Noddy Holder has had the same song become a hit eight times.

** How it Lands **
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who would be familiar with Noddy Holder and Slade's music, including their Christmas hit. The joke relies on a play on expectations, and the punchline is quick and easy to understand, making it accessible to a wide audience. The joke also doesn't rely on complex setup or inside knowledge, making it a great fit for a quick introduction.

** Funniness Ratings **
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

# Louise Wener's intro
** Intended Humour **
The intended joke here is about Louise Wener's photo on her band's new album featuring her as a "weedy nine-year-old with gimpy clothes and glasses." This joke is likely meant to poke fun at the idea of trying to present a cool image, but instead showcasing an awkward childhood photo. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on what one would expect from a rockstar's album cover and the use of the words "weedy," "gimpy," and "glasses" to create a vivid image of an awkward child.

** How it Lands **
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who would be familiar with the idea of rockstars trying to present a cool image and the humor in subverting those expectations. The joke relies on a quick and easy-to-understand setup, and the punchline is relatable to anyone who has ever felt awkward as a child.

# Jonathan Ross's intro
** Intended Humour **
The intended joke here is about Jonathan Ross having made his first-ever TV appearance with a walk-on part in Dad's Army and being "surprisingly still alive." This joke is likely meant to poke fun at the idea that Jonathan Ross has been around for a long time and has managed to survive despite his early start in the industry. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on what one would expect from a typical biography – instead of highlighting his achievements, the joke focuses on his longevity.

** How it Lands **
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who would be familiar with Jonathan Ross and his long career in television. The joke relies on a quick and easy-to-understand setup, and the punchline is relatable to anyone who has ever felt like they've been around for a long time.

# Intro Text

Sean's first guest is Norman Blake, singer with jangly top five album stars, Teenage Fanclub. Teenage Fanclub have been compared to The Beatles – three of them are delighted and the drummer's suing for slander. Sean's second guest is Math Priest from Dodgy. The band once played at a village fete where they supported The Jam. They've been asked back next year to support The Cakes and the Tombola. Phil's first guest is pop superstar and official world's sexiest woman, Louise. Louise's boyfriend is Liverpool footballer, Jamie Redknapp. He's a romantic soul and often takes her to the ground for intimate candlelit dinners of pies, Bovril, and Wagon Wheels. Phil's second guest is comedian Jeff Green. Jeff's one of the country's most popular stand-ups and famous for his razor-sharp observation. Only this morning he came up with, "Christ, this razor's sharp."

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Norman Blake's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke here is a play on the idea that being compared to The Beatles is a great honor for most musicians. However, the punchline subverts this expectation by stating that the drummer is suing for slander, implying that being compared to the drummer of The Beatles (Ringo Starr) is an insult. This is likely intended to poke fun at the common perception that Ringo is the least talented member of the band.

**How it Lands**
This joke would likely land well with the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with The Beatles and their individual reputations. The unexpected twist on the usual expectation of being compared to The Beatles creates surprise and incongruity, which can lead to humor. The joke also relies on some basic knowledge of the band and their members, making it more relatable and accessible to the audience.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the audience's perspective: 4 (LOL) - This joke has a clear setup and punchline, and the unexpected twist creates surprise and delight.
From a comedy writer's perspective: 3.5 (between an audible snort and LOL) - While the joke is well-crafted and has a clear structure, the humor may be more of a chuckle than a full laugh, as it relies on a somewhat specific piece of knowledge about The Beatles.

# Math Priest's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke here is a play on the idea of a band's typical gig schedule, with the punchline being that instead of playing with another band, they're supporting "The Cakes and the Tombola" at a village fete. This is likely intended to poke fun at the idea that the band's career is not taking off, and they're relegated to playing at small, low-profile events.

**How it Lands**
This joke would likely land well with the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the stereotypes of rock bands and their typical gig schedules. The unexpected twist on the usual expectation of a band's gig schedule creates surprise and incongruity, which can lead to humor. The joke also relies on some basic knowledge of village fetes and their typical activities, making it more relatable and accessible to the audience.

**Intended Humour**
The joke here is a play on the idea of a romantic dinner, with the punchline being that instead of a typical romantic dinner, Jamie Redknapp takes Louise to the football ground for a dinner of pies, Bovril, and Wagon Wheels. This is likely intended to poke fun at the idea of footballers being romantic, and the stereotype that they are not typically associated with fine dining.

**How it Lands**
This joke would likely land well with the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the stereotypes of footballers and their typical interests. The unexpected twist on the usual expectation of a romantic dinner creates surprise and incongruity, which can lead to humor. The joke also relies on some basic knowledge of football grounds and their typical food options, making it more relatable and accessible to the audience.

# Jeff Green's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke here is a play on the idea of a comedian's observational humor, with the punchline being that Jeff Green's latest observation is simply "Christ, this razor's sharp." This is likely intended to poke fun at the idea that observational humor can be simplistic or obvious.

**How it Lands**
This joke would likely land well with the show's typical audience, who are likely familiar with the concept of observational humor and its typical pitfalls. The unexpected twist on the usual expectation of a comedian's observation creates surprise and incongruity, which can lead to humor. The joke also relies on some basic knowledge of comedy and its typical tropes, making it more relatable and accessible to the audience.

Its analysis suggests the joke is more successful than it is, and the ratings (4/4.5) are way off from gold's more critical assessment (2/3). The model seems to mistake straightforwardness for comedic success.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 06: Saffron, Brian Molko, David Baddiel, Bruce Dickinson

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil’s first guest is Brian Molko, singer with top five fit goth blouses Placebo. The band are named after a type of medication, like many other groups: Brian Eno's adamant acid and Dexy's Midnight Rennies. 

Phil's second guest is heavy metal warrior Bruce Dickinson, formerly singer with satanic cock rockers Iron Maiden. In The Maiden, Bruce knew all too well the number of the beast; in fact, the beast has since gone ex-directory to get rid of him.

Sean's first guest is Saffron, singer with top ten techno monkeys Republica. Republica's hit "Ready To Go" was played on Baywatch, the only show where both the soundtrack and the cast are available in vinyl. 

Sean’s second guest is comedian, author, and chart topper David Baddiel. David’s got a new video out right now. It’s called Swedish Lesbian Sauna Schoolgirls and it’s due back on Wednesday.

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Brian Molko's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Brian Molko's intro is a play on words, comparing the band name "Placebo" to other fictional band names that sound like medications, such as "Adamant Acid" and "Dexy's Midnight Rennies". The humour comes from the unexpected twist on the typical band name inspirations, and the silly names created to fit the medication theme. The use of "adamant acid" is particularly clever, as it sounds like a real medication, but is actually a play on the phrase "adamant" meaning stubborn or unyielding.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with the music industry and appreciate clever wordplay. The joke is quick-witted and doesn't require a lot of setup, making it easy to follow and enjoy. The use of fictional band names adds to the humour, as it creates a sense of absurdity and playfulness.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 4 (LOL)

# Bruce Dickinson's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Bruce Dickinson's intro is a play on the idea of the "number of the beast" (a reference to the Iron Maiden song) and the concept of a phone number. The humour comes from the unexpected twist on the typical meaning of the phrase, and the idea that the "beast" has gone ex-directory to avoid Bruce. The joke relies on a basic understanding of the Iron Maiden song and the concept of phone directories.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with heavy metal music and appreciate clever twists on familiar concepts. The joke is well-structured and has a clear punchline, making it easy to follow and enjoy. However, the joke may not be as funny to those who are not familiar with the Iron Maiden song or the concept of phone directories.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 4 (LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3.5 (between an audible snort and LOL)

# Saffron's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Saffron's intro is a play on the idea of the TV show Baywatch being known for its attractive cast, and the concept of vinyl records. The humour comes from the unexpected comparison between the cast and the soundtrack being available in vinyl, implying that the cast is also a commodity that can be purchased. The joke relies on a basic understanding of the TV show Baywatch and the concept of vinyl records.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with popular culture and appreciate clever comparisons. The joke is quick-witted and doesn't require a lot of setup, making it easy to follow and enjoy. However, the joke may not be as funny to those who are not familiar with Baywatch or vinyl records.

From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3.5 (between an audible snort and LOL)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 3 (an audible snort)

# David Baddiel's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in David Baddiel's intro is a play on the idea of a video title being provocative and attention-grabbing, and the concept of a video rental due date. The humour comes from the unexpected twist on the typical video title, and the idea that the video is due back on Wednesday, implying that it's a rental video rather than a purchased one. The joke relies on a basic understanding of video rentals and the concept of due dates.

**How it Lands**
This joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with video rentals and appreciate clever twists on familiar concepts. The joke is well-structured and has a clear punchline, making it easy to follow and enjoy. The use of a provocative title adds to the humour, as it creates a sense of surprise and playfulness.

Judge Analysis: The model completely misread the effectiveness of this intro's humor, rating it highly (4/5) when the gold standard considered it a clear failure (1/5). The model saw clever wordplay where there was actually strained, awkward humor. It missed that 'fit goth blouses' was an awkward descriptor rather than witty. The analysis lacks insight into why the medication-themed names don't work comedically.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 05: Mark Owen, Lisa l'Anson, Shovell, Richard Fairbrass

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Phil's first guest is Richard Fairbrass from Right Said Fred. Richard is a singer and TV presenter who's brought his own weightlifting gym. He's now an expert at the clean and the jerk, but he curiously has no interest in the snatch.

Phil's second guest is Radio 1 star DJ and TV presenter Lisa I'Anson. Lisa's had a long association with pop music and recently worked with Wings. She does the voiceover on the Bodyform ads. 

Shaun's first guest is Shovell, percussionist with M People.

Shaun's second guest is heartthrob and platinum-selling pop sensation Mark Owen. Mark used to work in a bank but now gets hundreds of fan letters a week. He replies diligently to every letter and charges a mere 15-pound administration fee for each one.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Richard Fairbrass' intro
**Intended Humor**
Richard's introduction contains a joke centered around weightlifting terminology. The punchline relies on the double entendre of the word "snatch," which has both a weightlifting and a colloquial meaning. The joke works by setting up Richard as an expert in two weightlifting techniques, the clean and the jerk, but then subverts expectations by stating he has no interest in the snatch. The humor is intended to come from the unexpected twist on the word's meaning and the implied risqué nature of the word "snatch" in its colloquial sense.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke likely lands well. The audience is likely familiar with the double meaning of the word "snatch," and the joke doesn't require a deep understanding of weightlifting terminology. The joke's lighthearted and playful nature fits well with the tone of the show. However, the joke's impact may be somewhat diminished by its relatively simple and predictable structure.

**Funniness Ratings**
From the perspective of the audience watching at home: 3 (An audible snort)
From the perspective of a comedy writer: 2 (A minor exhale out the nose)

# Lisa I'Anson's intro
**No Joke Present**
Lisa's introduction is purely informational and doesn't contain a joke. It provides background information on her association with pop music and her work with Wings, as well as her role in the Bodyform ads. The tone is neutral and doesn't attempt to be humorous.

# Shovell's intro
**No Joke Present**
Shovell's introduction is brief and simply states his profession as a percussionist with M People. There is no attempt at humor in this introduction.

# Mark Owen's intro
**Intended Humor**
Mark's introduction contains a joke centered around his response to fan mail. The punchline relies on the unexpected twist that Mark charges a £15 administration fee for each letter he replies to. The humor is intended to come from the absurdity of charging fans for responding to their mail, as well as the implied greed and commercialization of Mark's fame.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke likely lands well. The audience is likely familiar with the idea of celebrities responding to fan mail, and the joke's unexpected twist adds a layer of humor. The joke's impact is further amplified by the deadpan delivery and the ridiculousness of the administration fee.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 02: Gary Barlow, Edwyn Collins, Jeff Green, Tony Wright

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Scottish singer-songwriter, Edwin Collins. Edwin's first job was as an artist in Glasgow’s parks. His finest works included Still Life with Park Bench, Dead Tramp in Hedge, and the classic Dog Crapping on Bowling Green.

Sean's second guest is comedian Jeff Green. Embarrassingly, Jeff was once a fan of soprano choir boy Aled Jones, and then the penny dropped, among other things. 

Phil's first guest is Tony Wright, singer with Brit rock gods, Terrorvision. The band are such hellraisers that on a tour of America, they once carried on partying during an earthquake. In fact, the first they knew about it was when Charlton Heston appeared and led them to safety.

Phil's second guest is Gary Barlow. He's now a successful solo artist, and we've been asked not to mention his boy band past. He can take almost anything but he can't take that. I'm sorry about that Gary.

#----------------------#
# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Edwin Collins' intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The intended humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical artist's works. Instead of listing famous paintings or masterpieces, the introduction lists humorous and mundane scenes that one might find in a park, such as a "Dead Tramp in Hedge" or "Dog Crapping on Bowling Green". The humor also comes from the seriousness with which these works are presented, using artistic terms like "Still Life" to describe something as ordinary as a park bench.

The joke relies on the audience's familiarity with artistic terminology and the expectation that an artist's works would be grand and impressive. The punchline subverts this expectation, creating humor through the absurdity of the situation.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The audience is likely familiar with artistic terminology and will appreciate the clever wordplay. The joke is also quick-witted and doesn't rely on complex setup or inside knowledge, making it accessible to a wide range of viewers.

The joke is funny because it's a clever play on expectations, and the use of artistic terminology adds to the absurdity of the situation. The humor is also somewhat dark and irreverent, which fits with the tone of the show.

# Jeff Green's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The intended humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical fanboy story. Instead of simply stating that Jeff was a fan of Aled Jones, the introduction adds a layer of embarrassment by implying that Jeff's admiration was not just musical, but also physical. The phrase "and then the penny dropped, among other things" is a clever play on words, suggesting that Jeff's infatuation with Aled Jones was not just innocent.

The joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the concept of a "crush" and the embarrassment that comes with admitting to having one. The punchline is a clever play on words, using the phrase "the penny dropped" (meaning to realize something) and adding "among other things" to imply that Jeff's realization was not just intellectual, but also physical.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to land well. The audience is likely familiar with the concept of a crush and will appreciate the clever wordplay. The joke is also quick-witted and doesn't rely on complex setup or inside knowledge, making it accessible to a wide range of viewers.

# Tony Wright's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The intended humor comes from the absurdity of the situation. The idea that a rock band is so hell-bent on partying that they continue to do so during an earthquake is ridiculous and humorous. The addition of Charlton Heston appearing and leading them to safety is an unexpected twist that adds to the absurdity of the situation.

The joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the concept of rock bands being wild and crazy, and the expectation that they would be aware of and respond to an earthquake. The punchline subverts this expectation, creating humor through the absurdity of the situation.

# Gary Barlow's intro
**Intended Humour**
This introduction contains a joke. The intended humor comes from the clever play on words and the unexpected twist on the typical "don't mention the past" request. Instead of simply stating that Gary Barlow doesn't want to talk about his boy band past, the introduction adds a layer of humor by implying that Gary is sensitive about the topic and can't take the mention of it.

The joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the concept of celebrities being sensitive about their past, and the expectation that they would want to avoid talking about embarrassing or awkward topics. The punchline subverts this expectation, creating humor through the clever play on words.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 04: Midge Ure, Shellie Poole, Math Priest, Graham Norton

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Shelly Poole from platinum album sellers Alisha’s Attic. Shelly’s dad Brian was a rock star in the sixties, so he’d shout things like turn that bloody music up! What time do I call this! And: get upstairs and trash your bedroom! Sean’s second guest is Math Priest from top five stars and Britpop heroes Dodgy. Dodgy recently went on a tour of Sarajevo, where they argued so much that the Bosnian Serbs offered to mediate a band meeting. Shelly and Math, ladies and gentlemen, Sean’s team. 

Phil’s first guest is legendary singer-songwriter Midge Ure. Midge has sung vocals on three number ones by different artists, and what an enjoyable evening’s karaoke that turned out to be. Phil’s second guest is comedian Graham Norton. Since Graham took over the nightly chat show on Channel Five, he’s become famous wherever he goes. Inside the Channel Five Building, ladies and gentlemen, Midge and Graham, Phil’s team.

# Test Model Analysis
#----------------------#
# Shelly Poole's intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Shelly's intro comes from the subversion of expectations regarding her dad, Brian, being a rock star in the sixties. The setup primes the audience to anticipate the typical 'rock star dad' stereotype - someone who's loud, rebellious, and anti-establishment. However, instead of shouting typical 'rock star' phrases, Brian's quotes are parental and authoritative, like "turn that bloody music up!" (not down, as one would expect from a parent, but up, showing his 'rock star' influence), "What time do I call this!" (a play on "what time do you call this!", again a parental phrase but with a twist of the dad himself being the one to stay up late), and "get upstairs and trash your bedroom!" (exaggerating a 'rock star' attitude by encouraging messy, wild behaviour). This unexpected twist creates the humour.

**How it Lands**
Considering the show's typical audience, this joke is likely to resonate with those familiar with British culture and the 'rock star' stereotype. The unexpected twist on the parental phrases will likely elicit a chuckle from the audience, especially those who have experienced overbearing or unconventional parenting. However, some audience members might find the joke a bit corny or predictable.

The joke's strength lies in its lighthearted, playful take on the 'rock star dad' stereotype, making it an amusing and relatable anecdote. The show's host, Sean, delivers the lines in a deadpan style, adding to the comedic effect.

**Funniness Ratings**
- Audience at home: 3 (An audible snort) - the joke is amusing and will likely elicit a chuckle, but it's not laugh-out-loud hilarious.
- Comedy writer: 2.5 (Between a minor exhale and an audible snort) - the joke is well-crafted, but it may be considered a bit corny or predictable by some.

# Math Priest's intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Math's intro comes from the unexpected and absurd scenario of the Bosnian Serbs offering to mediate a band meeting. The setup establishes that Dodgy went on a tour of Sarajevo, which primes the audience to anticipate a sombre or serious anecdote about the band's experience in a war-torn city. Instead, the punchline subverts this expectation with a ridiculous and humorous twist.

**How it Lands**
This joke will likely resonate with the show's audience, who are familiar with British culture and the Bosnian War. The absurdity of the situation creates a comedic effect, as it's hard to imagine a more unlikely or bizarre scenario. The joke relies on a certain level of cultural knowledge and understanding of the Bosnian War, but the absurdity of the situation makes it accessible to a wider audience.

The joke's strength lies in its unexpected twist and absurdity, making it a memorable and amusing anecdote.

**Funniness Ratings**
- Audience at home: 4 (LOL) - the joke is unexpected and absurd, making it laugh-out-loud funny.
- Comedy writer: 4 (LOL) - the joke is well-crafted, and the absurdity of the situation makes it a great comedic effect.

# Midge Ure's intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Midge's intro comes from the understatement and dry wit of the phrase "what an enjoyable evening's karaoke that turned out to be." The setup establishes that Midge has sung vocals on three number ones by different artists, which primes the audience to anticipate a boastful or proud anecdote. Instead, the punchline downplays the achievement with a humorous, tongue-in-cheek remark.

**How it Lands**
This joke will likely resonate with the show's audience, who appreciate dry wit and understatement. The joke relies on a certain level of cultural knowledge and understanding of the music industry, but the deadpan delivery makes it accessible to a wider audience.

# Graham Norton's intro
**Intended Humour**
The intended humour in Graham's intro comes from the self-deprecating remark about his fame being limited to the Channel Five Building. The setup establishes that Graham has become famous since taking over the nightly chat show, which primes the audience to anticipate a boastful or proud anecdote. Instead, the punchline downplays the achievement with a humorous, self-deprecating remark.

**How it Lands**
This joke will likely resonate with the show's audience, who appreciate self-deprecation and irony. The joke relies on a certain level of cultural knowledge and understanding of the TV industry, but the deadpan delivery makes it accessible to a wider audience.

It incorrectly frames it as being about 'parental and authoritative' quotes when the gold standard correctly identifies it's about role reversal - a rock star parent encouraging rather than discouraging rock star behavior.

Sean’s second guest is Essex-born singer-songwriter Billy Bragg.
In his youth, Billy joined the army but bought himself out after only 90 days. Later we'll be having a whip round to see if we can buy him back in. 

Phil's first guest is Sarah Blackwood, singer with glamorous Northern electropopsters Dubstar.
Sarah was once scolded by her mum for saying the word “blimey” on Richard and Judy. Quite right too. The words “tosser” and “irritating old hag” would have been far more appropriate. Phil's second guest is Neil Morrissey. He's an actor who comes from Stoke where remarkably his hairstyle is still ahead of the times.

# Richard Fairbrass' intro

**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains two comedic elements. The first is the playful use of Right Said Fred's hit song lyrics, "Too sexy for my shirt," which sets a lighthearted and humorous tone. The second joke is the punchline about Richard having to confess to his parents that he'd become a TV presenter, implying that being a TV presenter is somehow shameful or embarrassing, especially in contrast to his earlier career as a singer.

The humor in this joke relies on the unexpected twist on the typical "coming out" narrative, where a person confesses their true identity or orientation to their loved ones. In this case, the joke subverts this expectation by making Richard's confession about his career change, rather than a personal secret. The humor also comes from the idea that being a TV presenter is somehow less respectable or more embarrassing than being a singer.

**How it Lands**
The joke is likely to land well with the show's typical audience, who are familiar with Right Said Fred's music and the format of the show. The use of the song lyrics and the quick-witted punchline will likely elicit a chuckle from the audience. However, the joke may not be laugh-out-loud hilarious, as it relies on a relatively simple play on words and a familiar trope.

* Audience at home: 3 (An audible snort)
* Comedy writer: 2.5 (Between a minor exhale and an audible snort)

# Billy Bragg's intro

**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke about Billy Bragg's short stint in the army and the idea of a "whip round" to buy him back in. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical narrative of someone leaving the army, and the absurdity of the idea that a group of people would collectively try to buy someone back into the army.

The joke relies on a quick-witted play on words and the use of a familiar phrase ("whip round") in a new and unexpected context. The humor also comes from the idea that Billy Bragg's decision to leave the army was somehow a mistake or a failure, and that he needs to be "bought back in" to rectify the situation.

# Sarah Blackwood's intro

**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke about Sarah Blackwood being scolded by her mum for saying the word "blimey" on TV, and the suggestion that more severe language would have been more appropriate to describe Richard and Judy. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical narrative of someone being scolded for using bad language, and the absurdity of the idea that more severe language would be acceptable in this context.

The joke relies on a quick-witted play on words and the use of a familiar phrase ("blimey") in a new and unexpected context. The humor also comes from the idea that Richard and Judy are somehow deserving of more severe language, implying that they are annoying or irritating.

# Neil Morrissey's intro

**Intended Humour**
The introduction contains a joke about Neil Morrissey's hairstyle being "ahead of the times" in Stoke. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical narrative of someone's hairstyle being fashionable or trendy, and the absurdity of the idea that Stoke is somehow a hub of fashion or style.

The joke relies on a quick-witted play on words and the use of a familiar phrase ("ahead of the times") in a new and unexpected context. The humor also comes from the idea that Stoke is somehow a place where fashion or style is not typically associated, implying that Neil Morrissey's hairstyle is somehow remarkable or exceptional.

Contestant: Richard Fairbrass
Judge Analysis: The model completely missed the core comedic element - the inversion of 'coming out' expectations given Fairbrass's sexuality and Gay Time TV. Instead, it focused superficially on the TV presenter angle. This shows poor understanding of cultural context and subtext. The analysis lacks insight into why this joke is particularly clever for this specific person. Funniness ratings are too low given the gold standard's assessment of this as the strongest joke.

Never Mind the Buzzcocks Season 02 Episode 01: Marie DuSantiago, Mark Little, Shaggy, Suggs

#----------------------#
# Intro Text
#----------------------#
Sean's first guest is Marie De Santiago, the guitarist in Sunderland's Kenickie. They've been called the Cities answer to the Spice Girls, which is of course ridiculous. Their music is much better and their combined age is still younger than Ginger Spice. Sean's second guest is actor and comedian Mark Little. He played Joe Mangle in neighbors and then spent two years doing The Big Breakfast with extra sausages by the look of it.

Phil's first guest is Suggs. After his last appearance on the show the Madness frontman announced his total retirement from pop quizzes. He spent the last year hosting a pop quiz and here he is tonight on a pop quiz. Sean's other guest is Jamaican superstar Shaggy. He took his name from one of the characters in Scooby Doo. He chose Shaggy because "fat bird with the pleated skirt and glasses" didn't have the right ring to it.

# Marie De Santiago's intro
**Intended Humour**
The joke in Marie De Santiago's intro is a comparison between Kenickie and the Spice Girls. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical comparison. Instead of simply saying Kenickie is similar to the Spice Girls, the intro states that their music is "much better" and that their combined age is "still younger than Ginger Spice." The punchline relies on the audience's familiarity with the Spice Girls and the common perception that they are a manufactured, bubblegum pop group. By saying Kenickie's music is better, the intro is making a humorous commentary on the Spice Girls' music. The added jab about Ginger Spice's age is a lighthearted way to poke fun at the Spice Girls' image.

Contestant: Marie De Santiago
Judge Analysis: The model misunderstands the joke's effectiveness, rating it much higher than the gold standard. It fails to recognize the formulaic nature of the Spice Girls comparison and treats it as more clever than it is. The analysis is surface-level, missing the 'lackluster execution' noted in the gold response. The funniness ratings (4/3) are way off compared to gold (2/1).

Judge Analysis: The model correctly identifies the weight joke but misses the key element that makes it work - the 'unexpected and delightful phrasing' of 'extra sausages' noted in the gold response. Instead, treats it as a basic weight joke. The analysis lacks depth and insight into why the execution elevates the basic premise. Funniness ratings (3/2) are slightly off from gold (3/3).
