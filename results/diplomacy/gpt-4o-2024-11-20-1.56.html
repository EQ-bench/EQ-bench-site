<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1901, Austria successfully moved A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB, securing a foothold in the Balkans. However, A VIE's move to GAL was blocked by Russia's A WAR, creating tension. Italy's unexpected move of A VEN to TRI resulted in the loss of Trieste, complicating relations with Italy.
Negotiations focused on stabilizing the Balkans and managing tensions. Italy agreed to hold A TRI and accepted support for their move to Greece with F ALB - GRE. Russia agreed to refrain from moving A WAR to GAL in exchange for Austria not contesting Rumania and maintaining peace in Galicia. Turkey confirmed their focus on Bulgaria and suggested Austria secure Serbia. Promises were made to Italy and Turkey to support their respective moves, while Russia was assured of non-interference in Rumania and Galicia. Turkey's message hinted at potential future betrayal, warranting caution.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Support ITA's move to Greece with F ALB - GRE. Move A SER to secure Serbia. Hold A VIE to avoid provoking Russia in Galicia. Maintain cooperation with ITA, RUS, and TUR while monitoring for potential betrayals. Reassess the situation in Trieste after Italy's next move.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1901M, I held A SER and repositioned A VIE to BUD. No significant conflicts arose directly involving Austria, but TUR moved A BUL to RUM, consolidating their position in the Balkans. In W1901A, no builds were available for Austria, while other powers reinforced their positions, notably ITA building A ROM and GER building A MUN.
Negotiations focused on securing cooperation in the Balkans. I offered ITA support for their move to Greece in exchange for holding A TRI and refraining from aggression toward Austrian territories. ITA agreed and expressed concerns about potential German aggression. With RUS, I reaffirmed our agreement to avoid conflict in Galicia and Rumania, agreeing to focus on Serbia and Greece while they focus on Rumania and Bulgaria. TUR confirmed they would not move against Serbia or Albania but repeatedly hinted at future betrayal, urging me to focus on ITA instead. Promises were upheld during negotiations, but TUR's repeated threats signal potential future conflict.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's move to Greece with F ALB - GRE while holding A SER and A BUD to maintain defensive positions. I aim to solidify cooperation with ITA and RUS while remaining cautious of TUR's intentions. I will monitor TUR closely and prepare for potential betrayal. Contingency plans for German aggression will also be considered.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1902M, Austria held its positions in Budapest and Serbia, maintaining a defensive posture. Italy moved A VEN to TRI, as promised, while Turkey and Russia continued to position themselves in the Balkans, with Turkey holding RUM and Russia moving A WAR to GAL. No direct conflicts occurred involving Austria, but tensions in the region remain high.
Negotiations focused on maintaining alliances and managing tensions in the Balkans. Italy confirmed holding A TRI and expressed concerns about Turkey and Germany, suggesting a coordinated defense. Russia proposed stability in Galicia and Rumania while hinting at countering Turkey. Turkey offered cooperation against Russia but subtly implied future betrayal. Promises included Austria supporting Italy's potential move to Greece and maintaining peace with Russia in Galicia and Rumania. Turkey sought assurances about Austrian intentions in Serbia and Albania while pushing for joint action against Russia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Austria intends to support Italy's move to Greece with F ALB - GRE if Italy proceeds, while holding A SER and A BUD defensively. The goal is to maintain the alliance with Italy, avoid conflict with Russia, and cautiously manage Turkey's ambitions. Austria will monitor Turkey's actions closely and prepare for potential duplicity. Coordination with Italy against Germany may be explored in future turns.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1902M, Austria held its positions in Budapest and Serbia while disbanding the fleet in Albania during the adjustment phase. Russia advanced into Vienna and Rumania, solidifying its presence in the Balkans. Turkey built an additional army in Smyrna, signaling potential aggression. Italy held Trieste but shifted focus to the Balkans. Germany expanded into Sweden and Galicia, while England and France consolidated their positions in the west.
Negotiations this round were focused on securing alliances and managing threats in the Balkans. Italy agreed to hold Trieste and support Austria's move to Greece, strengthening the AUT-ITA alliance. Russia agreed to maintain peace in Galicia and Rumania, though Turkey's aggressive stance toward Rumania complicates this. Turkey demanded support for A BUL to RUM, which Austria declined, leading to a deterioration in AUT-TUR relations. Italy expressed concerns about Germany's expansion and proposed joint efforts to contain GER and RUS. Turkey's final message indicated hostility due to Austria's refusal to support their move.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Austria intends to support Italy's move to Greece with A SER - GRE while holding A BUD to secure its position. The focus is on maintaining the alliance with Italy, preserving peace with Russia, and countering potential threats from Turkey and Germany. Austria will monitor Turkey's actions closely and prepare for potential conflict in the Balkans.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1903M, I attempted A SER - GRE to secure Greece, but TUR countered with A BUL - GRE, resulting in a standoff. RUS aggressively moved A VIE - BUD and A RUM - SEV, while TUR and ITA held their positions. The Balkans remain tense with no clear resolution.
Negotiations were focused on managing tensions in the Balkans. ITA reaffirmed their alliance and promised to hold A TRI while suggesting moves against RUM and GAL. TUR agreed to a temporary non-aggression pact but demanded future action against RUM, threatening to terminate the agreement otherwise. RUS maintained a cooperative tone, agreeing to avoid aggression toward BUD and SER, though their moves suggest a more assertive stance. Promises made include my support for ITA's position in Greece and a non-aggression pact with TUR for this turn. TUR's move to RUM and their demands for future support indicate potential instability in our agreement.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to proceed with A SER - GRE to secure Greece and maintain my alliance with ITA. A BUD will hold to defend against potential RUS aggression. I aim to avoid direct conflict with TUR this turn but will prepare for potential hostilities if their demands escalate. Diplomatically, I will continue to reassure RUS and ITA while managing TUR's expectations.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1903M, I successfully moved A SER to GRE, securing Greece. ITA held TRI, maintaining a defensive posture, while RUS advanced into RUM and GAL, increasing their presence in the Balkans. TUR and RUS clashed in RUM, and ITA moved to counter TUR in the Aegean. No significant changes occurred in other regions.
Negotiations this round were tense. ITA expressed concerns about both TUR and RUS, declining to support my move to Greece and focusing on defending TRI. TUR sought my active support against RUS in RUM and GAL but was disappointed by my neutrality. RUS and I maintained a cautious peace, with mutual assurances to avoid aggression. Promises made include holding A BUD defensively and not interfering with TUR's plans in RUM. ITA promised to hold TRI and coordinate against RUS in the future, while TUR expressed distrust due to my inaction.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to hold A BUD defensively to maintain peace with RUS and avoid provoking TUR. A GRE will hold to consolidate my position in the Balkans. I aim to strengthen my alliance with ITA by coordinating against RUS in the next phase while keeping TUR at bay. My immediate focus is on stability and positioning for future opportunities.</li>

Russia remained non-committal, neither confirming nor denying their intentions toward BUD or SER. Promises made: I assured Italy of my defensive stance in GRE and willingness to coordinate.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Russia advanced into BUD, but their A GAL was disbanded in the adjustment phase. Italy solidified their position in the Balkans by moving A ALB to SER and A TYR to VIE, while Turkey remained aggressive, taking a hostile stance. Germany built two armies, indicating a potential focus on land dominance, while Italy and Russia also made builds to strengthen their positions.
Negotiations this round were tense. Italy agreed to support my move of A BUD to SER with their A ALB, solidifying our alliance. Turkey remained hostile, rejecting all offers of a truce and threatening aggression against GRE and SER. Russia was non-committal, neither confirming nor denying their intentions regarding BUD or GRE. My focus was on securing Italy's cooperation and attempting to de-escalate tensions with Turkey and Russia, though the latter efforts were largely unsuccessful.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to move A BUD to SER with Italian support from A ALB to secure Serbia. A GRE will hold defensively to protect against Turkish aggression. The goal is to strengthen my position in the Balkans while maintaining my alliance with Italy and preparing for potential Turkish hostility. I will continue to monitor Russia's actions closely.</li>

Your move from TYR to VIE is also appreciated, as it strengthens our position against Russia. Let’s stay coordinated and keep the pressure on Turkey.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I appreciate your consideration of peace in the Balkans.

This will allow us both to focus on other threats without unnecessary conflict.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I understand your concerns, but I cannot commit to active support against Russia or Italy at this time.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, I held my positions in GRE and SER, with support from ITA in ALB. TUR and RUS clashed over BUL, while GER advanced into VIE, and ITA maintained its defensive posture. TUR's aggression and ITA's support were notable developments.
Negotiations this round were tense. ITA reaffirmed its alliance and proposed coordinated moves to pressure TUR and RUS, including advancing ALB to BUL and TYR to VIE. TUR rejected my truce offers and expressed hostility, demanding active support against RUS and ITA. RUS remained non-committal regarding a non-aggression pact. Promises made include ITA's commitment to move ALB to BUL and TYR to VIE, and my agreement to hold GRE defensively while supporting ITA's efforts.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to hold GRE defensively to maintain stability and support ITA's move to BUL. I will also encourage ITA's move from TRI to SER to pressure RUS. My focus remains on maintaining the alliance with ITA and avoiding direct conflict with RUS while preparing for potential TUR aggression.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Italy advanced aggressively into GRE and SER, displacing my units. Turkey supported an attack on SEV, while Russia retreated to UKR. Germany held its positions, consolidating its dominance in central Europe. France and England maneuvered in the west, with no direct impact on my position.
Negotiations this round were tense. Italy reaffirmed its alliance with me, agreeing to move ALB to BUL and BUD to SER while holding TRI. Turkey remained openly hostile, rejecting peace overtures and declaring its intent to attack GRE and SER. Russia did not confirm or deny the proposed non-aggression pact, leaving its intentions ambiguous. Promises were made to Italy to hold GRE defensively and support their moves, while Turkey's hostility solidified its position as an adversary.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to hold A GRE defensively to secure my position and support Italy's moves to BUL and SER. This aligns with our shared goal of countering Turkey's aggression. I will continue to seek clarity from Russia while preparing for potential hostilities. My focus remains on stabilizing the Balkans and maintaining the alliance with Italy.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>

Negotiations this round were tense. ITA confirmed their move from ALB to BUL with my support and expressed concern over GER's aggression, particularly A TRI to SER. TUR outright rejected my truce offers, maintaining a hostile stance and threatening attacks on GRE and SER. RUS remained non-committal but did not indicate immediate hostility.

<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's A ALB to BUL with A GRE to secure BUL and hold A BUL defensively to counter GER and TUR aggression. I will also hold SER to prevent GER's A TRI from advancing further. My goal is to stabilize the Balkans, maintain my alliance with ITA, and counter GER and TUR's threats. Deception will be minimal, as I need ITA's trust to counterbalance GER and TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior moves saw minimal direct action affecting Austria. Germany disbanded A BUR, and England built F EDI while France disbanded F ENG. Italy disbanded F NAP, and Germany built A BER. No immediate threats or changes to Austria's position occurred.
Negotiations were tense, particularly with Turkey, who remains openly hostile and declared intentions to move into RUM and SER, threatening Austrian stability. Italy reaffirmed its alliance with Austria, promising support for A ALB to BUL and requesting assurance that Austria would not move into TRI. Russia was non-committal regarding a non-aggression pact, leaving their intentions unclear. Promises were made to Italy to support their move to BUL and to refrain from entering TRI. Turkey's aggression and refusal to negotiate in good faith solidified their hostile stance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's A ALB to BUL with A GRE to maintain our alliance and counter Turkey's aggression. A BUL will hold defensively to protect against potential Turkish or German incursions. I will avoid moving into TRI as promised to Italy. My strategy is to solidify the alliance with Italy while preparing for potential Turkish hostility. I will monitor Russia's actions closely to determine their true intentions.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, I supported ITA's position in the Balkans by holding GRE and supporting ALB to BUL. GER advanced into SER, but ITA's move to TRI and their support for my position in the region helped maintain balance. TUR remained hostile, holding their positions but signaling aggression. RUS moved closer to the Balkans, with WAR moving to UKR and MOS to SEV, indicating potential future conflict.
Negotiations this round were tense. ITA reaffirmed their alliance and coordinated moves to pressure TUR and GER, committing to move ALB to BUL and TRI to TYR. TUR rejected all offers of de-escalation, openly declaring their intent to attack SER. RUS remained non-committal, neither confirming nor denying a non-aggression pact. Promises made include my support for ITA's move to BUL and holding SER defensively. TUR's hostility and refusal to negotiate solidified their antagonistic stance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's move from ALB to BUL with A GRE and hold SER defensively to counter TUR's aggression. I will continue to coordinate closely with ITA to secure the Balkans and push back against TUR and GER. I will also monitor RUS's movements carefully, as their intentions remain unclear. My strategy is to maintain the alliance with ITA while preparing for potential conflict with TUR and GER.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Italy's A ALB successfully moved to GRE, displacing my unit. My A BUL supported A GRE, but this was ineffective due to Turkey's aggression with A CON moving to BUL. Germany's A GAL retreated to BOH after being displaced. Russia and Turkey coordinated in the Balkans, with Russia moving A UKR to GAL and Turkey advancing into RUM and SEV.
Negotiations focused on maintaining the alliance with Italy and attempting to de-escalate tensions with Turkey and Russia. Italy confirmed their moves, including A BUL to RUM, which I agreed to support with A GRE. Italy expressed concerns about Russia's potential move into GAL and requested support, which I could not commit to this turn. Turkey and Russia remained unresponsive to my repeated offers of a non-aggression pact, signaling continued hostility. France offered non-interference in the East, which I acknowledged but did not engage further.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE to counter Turkey's aggression and maintain our alliance. A BUL will hold defensively to prevent further Turkish advances. I will continue to prioritize coordination with Italy while monitoring Russia's and Turkey's moves closely. Diplomatic efforts with Turkey and Russia will persist, but I expect little progress. Defensive positioning remains critical.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, I held my position in Greece while Italy advanced aggressively into the Balkans, taking Serbia and moving towards Rumania.

Negotiations this round focused on solidifying an alliance with Italy to counter Turkey and Russia in the Balkans. Italy and I agreed on coordinated moves: I will support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE, while Italy moves A SER to BUD and A ALB to BUL to pressure Turkey. Turkey was approached with a proposal for a truce, but no positive response was received. Russia was also offered a non-aggression pact, but no commitments were made. Italy has requested support for their expansion into Greece, which I have not explicitly agreed to, as it conflicts with my interests.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE to maintain our alliance and counter Turkey.

I aim to maintain defensive positions while leveraging Italy's aggression to weaken Turkey and Russia. Diplomatically, I will continue to push for a truce with Turkey and a non-aggression pact with Russia to reduce threats on multiple fronts.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Turkey aggressively moved to support A BUL to A GRE, signaling hostility. Italy advanced A SER to BUD, consolidating their position in the Balkans. Russia moved A GAL to RUM with support from SEV, indicating a push into the region. My position in Greece remains precarious, with threats from both Turkey and Russia.
Negotiations were tense. Italy reaffirmed their alliance and promised to support A BUL to RUM with A GRE while moving A SER to BUD. Turkey rejected all truce offers and reiterated their intent to support A BUL to A GRE, maintaining a hostile stance.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our alliance remains critical to stabilizing the Balkans. I propose we coordinate this turn by having A GRE support your A BUL to RUM. Additionally, I will hold Greece defensively to counter Turkey's aggression. Let me know if you need further adjustments to this plan.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Hostility between us only benefits others. I propose a truce: I will hold Greece defensively and not move against your positions if you refrain from attacking Greece or Serbia. Let us focus on mutual survival rather than conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: The Balkans are volatile, and continued aggression will only destabilize the region further. I propose a non-aggression pact: I will not interfere with your moves in Rumania or Galicia if you avoid advancing on Budapest or Serbia. Let us avoid unnecessary conflict.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings, Austria. I propose we continue our coordinated efforts in the Balkans. I suggest A VIE supports A BUD to RUM, and I will move A SER to BUL. This will further pressure Turkey and Russia. What are your thoughts?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your proposal aligns well with our goals. I will have A GRE support your A BUL to RUM as planned. Additionally, I will hold Greece defensively to counter Turkey's aggression. Let us continue to coordinate closely to secure the Balkans.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, continued conflict between us only weakens both of our positions. I urge you to reconsider a truce: I will hold Greece defensively and not move against your positions if you refrain from attacking Greece or Serbia. Let us focus on mutual survival and avoid unnecessary losses.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, the Balkans are at a tipping point. I propose a non-aggression pact: I will not interfere with your moves in Rumania or Galicia if you avoid advancing on Budapest or Serbia. Stability benefits us both, and I hope we can avoid unnecessary conflict.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree with your suggestion. A GRE supporting A BUL to RUM is acceptable. I will move A SER to BUL. This will put significant pressure on Turkey. Do you foresee any issues with Russia interfering?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Your offer of a truce is tempting, but I cannot trust you. Your weakness is an invitation to aggression. I will consider your offer, but only if you demonstrate your commitment to peace by withdrawing from GRE. Otherwise, I will assume you are preparing to betray me and will act accordingly.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, your proposal for a non-aggression pact is rejected. Your weakness is evident, and I intend to exploit it. Prepare for the inevitable.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your plan to move A SER to BUL while A GRE supports A BUL to RUM is solid and aligns with our shared goals. I will hold Greece defensively to counter Turkey's aggression. Let us remain vigilant about Russia's potential interference, but I trust our coordination will prevail.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I understand your hesitation, but continued conflict only weakens us both. I propose a truce: I will hold Greece defensively and not move against your positions if you refrain from attacking Greece or Serbia. Let us focus on survival and avoid unnecessary losses.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I urge you to reconsider your stance. A non-aggression pact between us would stabilize the Balkans and allow us to focus on other threats. I will not interfere with your moves in Rumania or Galicia if you avoid advancing on Budapest or Serbia. Let us avoid mutual destruction.</li>
</ul></div>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, I supported ITA's A SER to hold against TUR's aggression. TUR advanced into the Balkans with A RUM moving to BUL and F ANK moving to BLA, signaling continued hostility. ITA held their positions defensively, while GER and RUS coordinated to pressure ITA in VIE and GAL. ENG and FRA focused on Western Europe, with no direct impact on the Balkans.
Negotiations this round were tense. ITA and I solidified our alliance, agreeing on a coordinated attack against TUR. I promised to support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE and hold Greece defensively. TUR rejected all truce offers, demanding I vacate GRE as a sign of good faith, which I refused. RUS also rejected a non-aggression pact, signaling their intent to exploit my weakened position. ITA confirmed their moves to BUL and SER, aligning with our shared strategy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE, as agreed, while holding Greece defensively to counter TUR's aggression. This move aims to weaken TUR's position in the Balkans and strengthen my alliance with ITA. I will remain vigilant for potential interference from RUS or unexpected moves from TUR. My focus is on maintaining the alliance with ITA and stabilizing the Balkans.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, I supported ITA's A SER to BUL with A GRE, but TUR's A BUL retreated to CON. ITA successfully moved A BUD to SER, consolidating their position in the Balkans. TUR's aggression remains evident, while GER advanced into PRU and SIL, potentially threatening RUS.
Negotiations focused on solidifying the AUT-ITA alliance to counter TUR's aggression. I confirmed support for ITA's A SER to BUL with A GRE and agreed to hold defensively in Greece. TUR was repeatedly offered a truce to avoid further conflict, but no response was received. RUS was approached for a non-aggression pact and encouraged to focus on TUR, but they have not shown any willingness to cooperate. ITA confirmed their moves and sought assurance of my support, which I provided.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's A SER to BUL with A GRE as agreed, holding defensively in Greece to counter TUR. My strategy is to maintain the alliance with ITA and secure the Balkans while attempting to neutralize TUR's influence. I will continue to seek a truce with TUR and a non-aggression pact with RUS, though neither seems likely to materialize.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw Turkey aggressively push into the Balkans, with A CON moving to BUL and F EAS dislodging ITA's F AEG. Italy held its positions in the region and supported Austria's interests, while Russia advanced A UKR to RUM, further complicating the situation. Germany made a significant move into VIE, threatening Austria's former home centers.
Negotiations focused on stabilizing the Balkans amidst Turkey's aggression and Russia's opportunism. Italy reaffirmed its alliance with Austria, promising to support A BUL to RUM and proposing a joint strategy against Russia, particularly targeting SEV in the future. Turkey remained hostile, rejecting truce offers and signaling continued aggression. Russia did not respond to Austria's overtures for cooperation, maintaining a neutral but potentially threatening stance. Promises made include Italy's support for A BUL to RUM and Austria's reciprocal support for Italy's move.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed, solidifying our alliance and countering Turkey's aggression. I will also prepare for potential future coordination with ITA against Russia, particularly targeting SEV. Defensive posturing will be maintained to protect GRE from Turkish advances. Diplomatic efforts will continue to seek a truce with TUR and explore potential cooperation with RUS, though both seem unlikely to yield immediate results.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior moves saw minimal direct impact on Austria. France disbanded an army in Marseilles, Germany built two armies in Berlin and Kiel, and Italy disbanded an army in Galicia. Turkey remains aggressive, and Italy continues to consolidate its position in the Balkans.
Negotiations this phase focused on solidifying the AUT-ITA alliance and attempting to mitigate threats from TUR and RUS. Italy confirmed its moves of A SER to BUD and A BUL to RUM, with my support from A GRE. Italy also proposed coordinating fleets to blockade the Turkish coast and suggested a joint attack on SEV next turn. Turkey rejected all truce offers and maintained a hostile stance. Russia did not respond to my proposals for a non-aggression pact, leaving their intentions unclear.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE and hold defensively in Greece. I aim to strengthen the AUT-ITA alliance and prepare for a coordinated attack on SEV next turn. I will continue to attempt to de-escalate tensions with TUR and RUS, though their hostility may require defensive preparations. My focus remains on securing the Balkans and countering Turkish aggression.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Italy advanced aggressively, moving A SER to BUD, A BUL to RUM, and A TYR to VIE, while Turkey countered with A RUM to SEV and F BLA to RUM. Russia moved A UKR to RUM, creating a contested situation in the Balkans. My unit in GRE remained idle, as I had not committed to any moves.
Negotiations focused on solidifying the AUT-ITA alliance and coordinating moves against Turkey and Russia. Italy confirmed their moves and support for A BUL to RUM, while proposing a joint attack on SEV next turn. Turkey rejected peace overtures with hostility, vowing to crush both Austria and Italy. Russia remained unresponsive to my repeated offers of a non-aggression pact. Promises made include my support for A BUL to RUM with A GRE, and Italy's commitment to their stated moves.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as promised, solidifying our alliance and positioning for a joint attack on SEV next turn. I will continue to work closely with Italy to counter Turkey and Russia while maintaining defensive positioning in the Balkans.

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from Austria, with no moves made. Italy maintained a defensive posture while England advanced into the Western Mediterranean and Spain. Germany repositioned its armies, and Turkey and Russia clashed in Rumania, with Turkey holding its position. France moved into Burgundy, likely preparing for further action.
Negotiations this round were tense. Italy confirmed their move of A BUL to RUM, supported by my A GRE, and expects future coordination against Russia and Turkey. Turkey remained hostile, rejecting all truce offers and declaring their intent to attack Serbia. Russia did not respond to repeated non-aggression proposals. Promises made include my support for Italy's move to Rumania and a defensive stance in Greece to counter Turkey. Turkey's aggression and refusal to negotiate solidify their hostile stance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as promised. My position in Greece will remain defensive to counter Turkey's aggression.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Italy consolidated its position in the Balkans by moving A BUD to SER and A TRI to VIE, while Turkey aggressively moved A RUM to SEV and F BLA to RUM. England maintained its naval dominance, and Germany repositioned its armies. Austria held its position in Greece, avoiding direct conflict.
Negotiations this round were tense. Italy confirmed its support for A BUL to RUM and proposed moves to consolidate in BUD and GAL, with plans for a coordinated strike on Sevastopol next turn. Turkey remained hostile, rejecting all truce offers and threatening to move A CON to SER. Russia did not respond to repeated non-aggression proposals. Promises made: Italy will support A BUL to RUM, and Austria will reciprocate by supporting A BUL to RUM with A GRE. Turkey explicitly stated its intent to attack Serbia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed, solidifying our alliance and securing Rumania. I will hold my position in Greece to avoid unnecessary conflict with Turkey this turn, while preparing for a potential counterattack in the future. I aim to maintain Italy's trust and focus on stabilizing the Balkans while countering Turkey's aggression.</li>

Negotiations focused on solidifying the AUT-ITA alliance and coordinating moves in the Balkans. ITA confirmed their move of A VIE to GAL and support for A BUL to RUM, while requesting my support for their attack on SMY with F AEG, which I declined due to my focus on RUM and defensive positioning. TUR and RUS were repeatedly approached for truces or non-aggression pacts, but neither responded positively. ITA also raised concerns about ENG's wariness of my growing power, suggesting coordinated responses to maintain our alliance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE, ensuring our alliance remains strong and the Balkans are stabilized. I will not support ITA's attack on SMY this turn, prioritizing my defensive position in GRE.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior moves, GER retreated A MUN to TYR, and adjustments were made by FRA, ITA, and RUS, with FRA building A PAR, ITA building F ROM, and RUS building A WAR. TUR disbanded F AEG, signaling a potential shift in their naval focus.
Negotiations this round were tense. ITA confirmed their commitment to our alliance, proposing a coordinated attack on SEV and requesting A GRE support for A BUL to RUM, which I agreed to. TUR outright rejected my truce offers, responding with hostile and aggressive rhetoric, vowing to take Greece and Serbia. RUS did not respond to my repeated proposals for a non-aggression pact, leaving their intentions unclear. ITA also expressed concerns about FRA's presence in TUN, which may require future attention.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed, solidifying our alliance and positioning for a future attack on SEV. I will hold defensively in Greece against TUR's aggression while continuing to monitor FRA's actions in TUN. My strategy is to maintain the alliance with ITA, resist TUR's advances, and prepare for a coordinated strike on SEV next turn.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from AUT, with no orders issued. ITA continued to consolidate its position in the Balkans and moved F ION to AEG, signaling a focus on the eastern Mediterranean. TUR aggressively moved F BLA to SEV, while RUS attempted to reinforce RUM but failed. FRA advanced into KIE, potentially threatening GER. ENG maintained its naval dominance but did not make significant advances.
Negotiations this round were dominated by AUT's attempts to secure stability in the Balkans. ITA confirmed its commitment to the alliance, promising to move A BUL to RUM with support from A GRE and to position A VIE in GAL for a coordinated attack on SEV next turn. TUR remained hostile, rejecting all truce offers and threatening to invade Greece. RUS did not respond to repeated proposals for a non-aggression pact, maintaining its focus on the Balkans. FRA's intentions remain unclear, but ITA expressed concern about their potential interference.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> AUT intends to support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed, solidifying the alliance and weakening RUS. Defensive positioning in Greece will be maintained to counter TUR's aggression. The plan for a coordinated attack on SEV with ITA next turn remains a priority. Monitoring FRA's actions in the region is critical to anticipate any threats. Diplomatic efforts with TUR and RUS have failed, so focus will shift to strengthening the AUT-ITA alliance and preparing for potential hostilities.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from Austria as I held position in Greece. Italy moved A BOH to VIE and A APU to VEN, consolidating their position. Turkey advanced F BLA to SEV and F ANK to BLA, signaling aggression. Russia held in key positions, while England and France focused on naval and positional maneuvers.
Negotiations were tense. Italy confirmed their moves of A BUL to RUM and A VIE to GAL, expecting my support in RUM and planning a coordinated attack on SEV next turn. They expressed dissatisfaction with my inability to support their attack on SMY. Turkey remained hostile, rejecting all truce offers and threatening exploitation. Russia did not respond to my repeated proposals for a non-aggression pact. Promises made: I committed to supporting Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE this turn and to coordinate on SEV next turn. No promises were broken.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as promised, holding defensively in Greece to counter Turkey's aggression. I aim to maintain the alliance with Italy while preparing for a coordinated attack on SEV next turn. I will continue to seek opportunities to stabilize the region and counter Turkey's hostility.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw Italy advancing A VIE to GAL and A BUL to RUM, aligning with their stated plans. Turkey maintained its aggressive stance, with F BLA supporting F ANK, while Russia repositioned A MOS to UKR. England continued consolidating naval dominance, moving F AEG to CON and F MAO to NAF. Austria held its position in Greece, avoiding direct conflict.
Negotiations this round focused on coordinating with Italy for a joint attack on Sevastopol. Italy proposed moving A GRE to SEV with support from A GAL, diverging from my initial plan to position A GRE in BUL. I ultimately agreed to Italy's revised plan to ensure alignment. Attempts to negotiate a truce with Turkey and a non-aggression pact with Russia were met with silence, indicating continued hostility from both. Italy remains a strong ally, while Turkey and Russia remain adversarial.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE this turn, as promised. For the next turn, I will move A GRE to SEV with support from Italy's A GAL, as per our revised agreement. I will maintain defensive positioning against Turkey and continue efforts to diplomatically isolate them. No direct moves against Russia this turn, but preparations for the Sevastopol attack are underway.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, England consolidated its naval dominance with strategic builds and movements, including reinforcing the English Channel and Mediterranean. Italy maintained a defensive posture while positioning for future offensives. Turkey attempted to assert control in the Black Sea region, while Russia repositioned its forces in Ukraine. Austria remained static, with no moves executed.
Negotiations this round were dominated by attempts to solidify alliances and counter threats. Italy confirmed its commitment to supporting Austria's A GRE to SEV next turn and agreed to move A BUL to RUM and A GAL to UKR this turn. Turkey rejected all truce offers, maintaining a hostile stance and threatening aggression against Greece. Russia remained unresponsive to non-aggression proposals, leaving its intentions unclear. Austria reaffirmed its alliance with Italy and focused on coordinating moves to counter Turkey and Russia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as promised, solidifying our alliance and positioning for a coordinated attack on SEV next turn. I will maintain a defensive posture against Turkey, anticipating potential aggression. My strategy hinges on leveraging Italy's support to counterbalance Turkey and Russia while avoiding direct conflict with England or France.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our alliance remains strong, and I will support your A BUL to RUM with A GRE this turn as promised. Let us finalize plans for the coordinated attack on SEV next turn, with A GRE moving to SEV supported by your A GAL. Together, we can secure the Balkans and weaken our adversaries.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Hostility between us benefits neither of us. I propose a truce: I will hold defensively in Greece and avoid moves against you if you refrain from aggression toward my position. Let us stabilize the region and focus on mutual threats instead of unnecessary conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I once again propose a non-aggression pact between us. My focus is on stabilizing the Balkans and countering Turkey's aggression. If you are willing to avoid conflict with me, we can coexist peacefully and focus on other priorities.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I urge you to reconsider your stance. A truce between us would allow both of us to focus on more pressing threats.

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: AUT, excellent. I will move A VIE to GAL and A BUL to RUM to support your A GRE. I agree to coordinate the attack on SEV next turn. I suggest A GRE to SEV supported by A GAL.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I confirm my support for your A BUL to RUM with A GRE this turn and fully agree to the plan for A GRE to SEV supported by your A GAL next turn. Regarding the Balkans, I am most interested in securing Greece and potentially expanding into Serbia or Bulgaria, depending on how the situation evolves.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, ENG successfully retreated F CON to BUL/EC, consolidating their position in the Balkans. GER disbanded A PRU, and ITA disbanded A BOH, signaling a shift in their respective strategies. No other significant moves occurred.
Negotiations this round focused on solidifying alliances and addressing regional threats. ITA and I finalized plans for a coordinated attack on SEV next turn, with A GRE moving to SEV supported by A GAL. I promised to support ITA's A BUL to RUM this turn. TUR rejected my repeated offers of a truce, demanding my withdrawal from GRE, which I cannot concede. RUS remained unresponsive to my proposals for a non-aggression pact. ITA also raised concerns about ENG's growing power and proposed a future division of the Balkans, suggesting I take RUM and BUL while they claim SER and GRE.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as promised, maintaining our alliance. Next turn, I will move A GRE to SEV with support from ITA's A GAL to execute our coordinated attack. I will continue to hold defensively in GRE against TUR's pressure and maintain diplomatic efforts to secure a truce with TUR and a non-aggression pact with RUS. I will monitor ENG's movements but prioritize stabilizing the Balkans and eliminating TUR and RUS.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw minimal direct involvement from AUT. ENG made significant naval repositioning, consolidating control over key waterways and advancing into SPA/SC and NAF. ITA moved F WES to TYS, signaling a potential focus on the Mediterranean. TUR advanced F BLA to SEV, indicating aggression toward RUS, while FRA and GER largely held their positions. AUT remained static, avoiding conflict.
Negotiations this round focused on solidifying an alliance with ITA against RUS. ITA proposed a coordinated attack on SEV, with mutual support planned for the next two turns. AUT confirmed support for ITA's A BUL to RUM this turn and agreed to the SEV attack next turn. Attempts to secure a truce with TUR were rebuffed, as no response was received. Similarly, overtures to RUS for a non-aggression pact were ignored, solidifying distrust. ITA reaffirmed their commitment to the plan, ensuring alignment against RUS.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, A GRE will support ITA's A BUL to RUM as agreed. The plan is to maintain the alliance with ITA and execute the coordinated attack on SEV next turn. Efforts to de-escalate with TUR and RUS have failed, so defensive posturing will continue in the Balkans. The focus remains on leveraging the ITA alliance to weaken RUS while avoiding overextension.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior moves saw minimal activity from AUT, with no orders issued. ITA maintained its hold on key Balkan territories, while TUR and RUS postured aggressively. ENG continued its naval dominance, and FRA consolidated its position in central Europe. TUR remains fixated on Greece, and ITA has solidified its control over the Balkans.
Negotiations were tense. ITA reaffirmed its alliance with AUT, confirming plans to support A BUL to RUM this turn and coordinate an attack on SEV next turn. TUR rejected all truce offers, demanding Greece and threatening aggression. RUS ignored non-aggression overtures, maintaining a hostile stance. Promises were made to ITA to support their moves and coordinate against RUS and TUR, while no agreements were reached with TUR or RUS.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE this turn. Next turn, move A GRE to SEV with support from ITA's A GAL. Maintain the alliance with ITA to counter RUS and TUR.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from AUT as I held position in Greece. ITA maintained their positions while moving A GAL to UKR and A BUL to RUM, aligning with our plans. TUR continued their aggressive stance, consolidating forces in SMY. RUS moved A UKR to RUM, which will likely clash with ITA's move. ENG and FRA focused on consolidating their positions in the west, with no direct impact on the Balkans.
Negotiations this round were focused on solidifying the alliance with ITA and coordinating moves against RUS. ITA confirmed their moves of A BUL to RUM and A GAL to UKR, with plans to support my A GRE to SEV next turn. TUR rejected all offers of a truce, maintaining a hostile stance and demanding the cession of GRE. RUS ignored my repeated offers of a non-aggression pact, signaling continued hostility. Promises made include supporting ITA's A BUL to RUM this turn and coordinating an attack on SEV next turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed. This move is designed to weaken RUS and strengthen our alliance with ITA. Next turn, I plan to move A GRE to SEV with support from ITA's A GAL. I will continue to hold defensively against TUR, despite their threats, and maintain my focus on the Balkans. No deceptions are planned at this time, as maintaining trust with ITA is critical.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I urge you to consider my offer of a non-aggression pact. My focus is on stabilizing the Balkans, and I have no intention of advancing into your core territories. Cooperation between us could prevent unnecessary conflict and allow us to focus on more pressing threats.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, I held my position in Greece while Italy advanced into Serbia and Ukraine, consolidating their position in the Balkans. England disbanded their fleet in Bulgaria, reducing their presence in the region. Russia built an army in Moscow, signaling potential defensive or offensive maneuvers in the east. Turkey remains aggressive, with their fleet repositioning to Smyrna.
Negotiations this round were tense. Italy and I finalized a coordinated plan to support their A BUL to RUM this turn and to attack SEV next turn with A GRE supported by their A GAL. Italy also proposed builds to strengthen our Balkan positions, which I agreed to. Turkey issued repeated threats, demanding Greece and promising an attack with A SER to GRE. I refused to cede Greece and reiterated offers of a truce, which were rejected. Russia did not respond to my repeated offers of a non-aggression pact, maintaining a hostile stance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed. Next turn, I will move A GRE to SEV with support from ITA's A GAL. I aim to maintain my alliance with ITA while resisting TUR's aggression and preparing for potential conflict with RUS. My build priority will be TRI to strengthen my Balkan position.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Italy advanced A GAL to UKR and F AEG to CON, while Russia repositioned A UKR to SEV and A MOS to UKR. Turkey moved F BLA to SEV, signaling aggression towards Russia. France made significant moves in the west, including A RUH to HOL and A BUR to BEL, while England consolidated its naval dominance. My position in Greece remained static.
Negotiations were tense. Italy and I solidified our alliance, agreeing on coordinated moves against Russia, including my support for A BUL to RUM and a future attack on SEV. Italy also requested support for F AEG to CON, which I deferred for evaluation. Turkey remained hostile, rejecting all truce offers and threatening Greece. Russia ignored my overtures for a non-aggression pact, maintaining its focus on defending SEV and UKR. Promises made: I committed to supporting Italy's A BUL to RUM and aligning on a future attack on SEV.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE this turn, maintaining our alliance and setting up for a coordinated attack on SEV next turn. I will not support Italy's F AEG to CON this turn to avoid overcommitting and to keep options open. I will hold firm in Greece against Turkey's aggression while continuing to seek diplomatic openings with both Turkey and Russia. My primary goal is to maintain Italy's trust and secure a stronger position in the Balkans.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior moves saw no direct action from Austria. Italy maintained its position in the Balkans and moved A GAL to UKR, while Turkey aggressively moved F BLA to SEV and F CON to AEG. England expanded its naval presence, and France consolidated its forces in central Europe. Turkey's hostility towards Austria became evident with its aggressive posturing, while Italy continued to align with Austria against Russia.
Negotiations this round were tense. Italy confirmed its commitment to the alliance and the coordinated attack on Sevastopol, but expressed concerns about Austria's intentions in Greece due to Turkey's aggression. Turkey outright rejected Austria's truce offers, repeatedly threatening to take Greece with A SER. Russia remained silent, neither accepting nor rejecting Austria's non-aggression pact proposal. Promises made include Austria's support for Italy's A BUL to RUM this turn and the planned attack on SEV next turn with A GRE supported by A GAL. Turkey's hostility and refusal to negotiate have solidified its position as a direct threat.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, A GRE will support Italy's A BUL to RUM to maintain the alliance and prepare for the coordinated attack on SEV next turn. Defensive posturing in Greece will continue to counter Turkey's aggression. The alliance with Italy remains the priority, while efforts to de-escalate with Turkey and Russia have failed. Austria will focus on maintaining its position and leveraging Italy's support to counter threats.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from AUT as I held my position in Greece. ITA continued to consolidate its position in the Balkans, moving A GAL to UKR and holding other units. TUR aggressively moved F BLA to SEV and F CON to BLA, signaling hostility. RUS remained largely passive, holding its units. ENG and FRA continued their respective maneuvers in the west, with FRA advancing into HOL and KIE.
Negotiations this round were dominated by my coordination with ITA and failed attempts to de-escalate tensions with TUR. ITA and I finalized a plan to support A BUL to RUM this turn and execute a coordinated attack on SEV next turn, with A GRE moving to SEV supported by A GAL. TUR rejected all truce offers and reiterated its intent to seize Greece, maintaining a hostile stance. RUS remained silent, showing no interest in a non-aggression pact despite repeated overtures.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as promised. This is part of a broader strategy to secure the Balkans and eliminate the Russian threat. Next turn, I will move A GRE to SEV with support from ITA's A GAL. I will continue to hold defensively against TUR while maintaining my alliance with ITA. No deceptions are planned at this stage, as my focus is on stabilizing my position and countering immediate threats.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from most powers. My unit in Greece remained stationary. ITA maintained their positions while TUR moved aggressively, signaling hostility. RUS held defensively, and ENG and FRA continued to consolidate their positions in the west.
Negotiations this round were tense. ITA and I solidified our alliance, agreeing on a coordinated attack on RUM this turn and SEV next turn.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from Austria as I held my position in Greece. Italy maintained its defensive posture while coordinating with me for future moves. Turkey continued its aggressive stance, moving fleets to threaten my position. Russia repositioned its armies, with A UKR moving to RUM and A MOS advancing to STP. England and France largely held their positions, while Germany moved A HOL to KIE.
Negotiations were tense. Italy and I solidified our alliance, agreeing on a coordinated attack on Sevastopol next turn, with my A GRE supporting A BUL to RUM this turn. Turkey rejected all offers of a truce, issuing repeated threats to seize Greece. Russia ignored my non-aggression pact proposal, likely due to its focus on defending against our planned attack. Promises made include my support for Italy's A BUL to RUM and Italy's support for my A GRE to SEV next turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed. My strategy is to maintain the alliance with Italy and execute the planned attack on Sevastopol next turn. I will continue to hold defensively against Turkey while attempting to mitigate their aggression diplomatically. My focus remains on weakening Russia and securing the Balkans.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw minimal action from Austria as I held my position in Greece. Italy moved aggressively, with A RUM advancing to SEV and A VIE moving to BOH, signaling their commitment to pressuring Russia. England maintained a defensive naval stance, while France reinforced their position with a new fleet in Marseilles. Turkey and Russia remained largely static, though Russia repositioned A MOS to STP, likely to bolster their northern defenses.
Negotiations this round were dominated by Italy's commitment to a coordinated attack on Russia. Italy confirmed their moves of A BUL to RUM and A GAL to UKR, with plans to support my A GRE to SEV next turn. Turkey rejected all offers of a truce, issuing repeated threats to take Greece by force. Russia remained silent, likely unwilling to engage diplomatically. Promises were made to Italy to support their A BUL to RUM this turn, with a coordinated attack on SEV planned for the following turn. No agreements were reached with Turkey or Russia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support Italy's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as promised, solidifying our alliance and positioning for a joint attack on SEV next turn. I will maintain a defensive posture against Turkey, who has declared hostile intentions. My strategy is to strengthen ties with Italy while preparing for potential conflict with Turkey and continuing to pressure Russia.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from Austria as I held my position in Greece. Italy moved A BOH to SIL and A GAL supported A BOH, signaling their focus on Russia. Italy also moved F AEG to CON, potentially pressuring Turkey. Russia advanced A UKR to RUM and A MOS to STP, indicating a defensive posture in the north and a push in the Balkans.

Negotiations were tense. Italy and I solidified our alliance, agreeing on a coordinated attack on Sevastopol.

My offer of a truce remains open if you wish to avoid mutual losses and focus your efforts elsewhere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I urge you once more to consider a non-aggression pact. Escalation in the Balkans will only destabilize the region and benefit other powers. Let us focus on securing our respective positions and avoiding unnecessary conflict. Please confirm if you are open to this agreement.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: AUT, excellent. Let us proceed as planned. A GAL supports A GRE to BUL. A VIE moves to GAL. Next turn, we crush SEV!</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from most powers. My A GRE held position, while FRA advanced A KIE to BER and A MUN to SIL, consolidating their position in central Europe. ITA held most of their units but moved F AEG to CON, signaling potential aggression toward TUR. RUS repositioned their armies, with A UKR moving to SEV and A MOS to UKR, indicating a defensive stance in the Balkans. TUR moved F CON to SMY and supported it with F BLA, showing a focus on consolidating their southern position.
Negotiations this phase were tense. ITA and I solidified our alliance, agreeing on a coordinated attack on SEV next turn, with my A GRE supporting their A BUL to RUM this turn. TUR rejected all offers of a truce, maintaining a hostile stance and threatening to attack Greece. RUS ignored my repeated offers of a non-aggression pact, likely preparing for conflict in the Balkans. Promises made: I committed to supporting ITA's A BUL to RUM this turn and executing a joint attack on SEV next turn. TUR and RUS made no commitments, with TUR explicitly threatening aggression.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support ITA's A BUL to RUM with A GRE as agreed. This move strengthens our alliance and positions us for a coordinated attack on SEV next turn. I will continue to hold diplomatically firm against TUR's threats and maintain defensive posturing in Greece. My strategy is to solidify my alliance with ITA while preparing for potential conflict with TUR and RUS.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, FRA advanced aggressively into central Europe, positioning units in BOH, TYR, and BUR, while ITA consolidated its hold on the Balkans and moved A BUL to RUM. TUR moved F CON to AEG, signaling potential aggression in the region. RUS repositioned its forces, with A UKR moving to RUM and A MOS advancing to UKR, indicating a focus on the Balkans. ENG maintained a defensive posture, while GER lost PRU to FRA.
Negotiations this round were tense. ITA and I solidified our alliance, agreeing on a coordinated attack on RUM this turn and SEV next turn. ITA confirmed their moves: A BUL to RUM supported by A GRE, A GAL to UKR, and F AEG to SMY. TUR rejected all offers of a truce, repeatedly threatening to attack GRE with A SER.

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, excellent. I will support your move to Sevastopol with A GAL to UKR. I will also move A RUM to BUL supported by A GRE. Let us crush Russia together. I will also move A VIE to TRI to prepare for an attack on VIE. Do you agree?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I confirm my orders for this turn: A GRE will support your A BUL to RUM as agreed. Next turn, I will move A GRE to SEV with your A GAL providing support. Your plan to move A RUM to BUL with my support is excellent, and I also agree with your move of A VIE to TRI to prepare for an attack on VIE. Let’s execute this flawlessly and maintain our momentum.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I will not cede Greece, but I am willing to hold defensively and not advance into your territories if you agree to focus your efforts elsewhere. Mutual destruction benefits neither of us, and I urge you to reconsider your aggressive stance for the sake of regional stability.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, this is your final opportunity to discuss a non-aggression pact. If you are willing to focus your efforts elsewhere, I can ensure no immediate moves against your territories. Let us stabilize the region and avoid unnecessary conflict that will only weaken us both.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I will support your move to Sevastopol with A GAL to UKR. I will also move A RUM to BUL supported by A GRE. I will also move A VIE to TRI to prepare for an attack on VIE. Let us crush Russia and then turn on FRA and GER.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior move saw limited action from Austria, with no orders issued. Italy maintained its position in the Balkans and proposed further coordination. France advanced into key positions, including moving A TRI to VIE, while Turkey and Russia began to escalate their aggression in the region. Turkey moved F BLA to SEV, signaling hostility, and Russia held defensively but remains under pressure.
Negotiations this round were tense. Italy and Austria solidified their alliance, agreeing on a coordinated plan to support A BUL to RUM and prepare for a move on SEV. Italy also proposed moving A VIE to TRI to prepare for further offensives. Turkey rejected all offers of a truce, maintaining an aggressive stance and demanding Greece. Russia ignored repeated offers for a non-aggression pact, signaling continued hostility. Promises made include Austria supporting Italy's A BUL to RUM and Italy supporting Austria's A GRE to SEV in the next turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, A GRE will support Italy's A BUL to RUM as agreed. The plan is to maintain the alliance with Italy and execute the coordinated moves to pressure Russia. Defensive posturing will be maintained against Turkey, as no truce was reached. The long-term goal is to secure SEV and stabilize the Balkans while preparing for potential aggression from Turkey.</li>
