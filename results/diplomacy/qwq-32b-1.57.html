<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: To GER: I propose a strategic alliance to secure Central Europe. Let's divide the region: AUT will focus on Serbia (SER) and Rumania (RUM), while GER can expand northward. I suggest coordinating moves to avoid conflict. For instance, my army in VIE can support BUD's advance to SER, while your units in MUN and BER can push north. Let's discuss specifics to ensure mutual success.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: To ITA: I propose a non-aggression pact. AUT aims to secure the northern Balkans (SER, RUM), while ITA can focus on the Adriatic and southern territories (ALB, GRE). I will not oppose your moves southward, and I request the same in the north. Let's avoid conflict and expand our spheres of influence peacefully.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: To RUS: I propose a division of interests in the Balkans. Let's agree that Rumania (RUM) falls under my sphere while you secure the north. This avoids conflict between our forces. I suggest coordinating so that your units in WAR and SEV can focus on other targets while I handle RUM. Your thoughts?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, we propose a temporary alliance against Italy. We can coordinate our attacks to weaken them significantly. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To all powers, Turkey wishes to maintain peace and stability in the region. We are open to diplomatic discussions and cooperation to ensure a balanced and prosperous Europe.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, Italy proposes a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. We are both surrounded by potential enemies and cooperation would be mutually beneficial. I suggest we focus our efforts elsewhere and avoid conflict in the Adriatic. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To ALL, England wishes to state its intention to maintain the balance of power in Europe. We will act in accordance with our interests and expect others to do the same. Let us strive for a peaceful, if competitive, year.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany suggests a cooperative stance in the south. We have no immediate designs on your territory, and believe a strong Austria is beneficial to maintaining balance in the region. Perhaps we can coordinate against Italy?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we note your presence near Galicia. We are willing to discuss our mutual interests in the region to avoid any misunderstandings. Perhaps we can come to an agreement regarding our respective spheres of influence in the Balkans. What are your thoughts?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I accept your proposal for an alliance against Italy. Let us strike decisively at Venice (VEN) and the Adriatic. In exchange for your support, I agree that after weakening Italy, the Balkans will be divided to our mutual benefit. Austria secures Serbia (SER) and Rumania (RUM), while Turkey may expand into Albania (ALB) and Greece (GRE). Let us coordinate our moves this fall.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I propose a joint assault on Italy's Venice (VEN). My fleet in TRI can move to VEN, supported by army VIE, while your units in MUN could pressure Tyrolia (TYR) to block Italian reinforcements. This will cripple Italy's northern holdings. In return, I will not contest your expansion into Munich's sphere. Let us finalize coordinated orders.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, while I value our non-aggression pact, I must clarify: any Italian units north of the Adriatic (e.g., TYR, VEN) will be treated as hostile. Austria's focus remains on Serbia and Rumania. However, if Italy moves forces northward, I will respond accordingly. Let us maintain peace—but within clear boundaries.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we are amenable to a division of interests in the Balkans. We agree that Rumania falls under your sphere of influence, while we focus on the north. Let us coordinate our movements to avoid conflict and maximize our gains. We suggest you move to RUM and we will focus on other areas.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I accept your non-aggression pact. I agree to focus on the Adriatic and southward, while you expand in the northern Balkans. Let's coordinate to avoid stepping on each other's toes. I propose A VEN to Trieste as a show of good faith.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, we are considering Italy's offer of an alliance against Russia. However, we believe that Italy is the greater threat to both of us. Would you be interested in a coordinated attack on Italy? We could divide Italy's territories between us.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: To Turkey: Execute our alliance decisively. I commit F TRI to VEN, supported by A VIE. Your army in CON must advance to ALB to sever Italian supply lines. Simultaneously, A BUD secures SER. Ensure coordination to isolate VEN and cripple Italy's northern holdings this fall.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, confirm A MUN to TYR this fall. This blocks Italian reinforcements to VEN, enabling our joint assault. In return, I will not contest your expansion northward. Coordinate orders promptly to ensure mutual success.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your proposal to move A VEN to TRI is rejected. TRI is Austrian territory and off-limits. Our pact specifies boundaries: you focus south of the Adriatic, I on Serbia/Rumania. VEN is now a target—withdraw forces or face annihilation. Adhere strictly to agreed zones.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, excellent! We agree to the division of the Balkans. This turn, I will move A CON to BUL. Can you support this move? Also, I will move A SMY to ARM. What are your moves this turn to attack Italy?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, the proposal for a joint assault on Venice is intriguing. However, we believe a more strategic approach would be to focus on Trieste first. If we take Trieste, we cut off Italy's access to the Adriatic and open a path to Vienna. What are your thoughts on this revised strategy?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I understand your concern about my units moving north. I propose a more concrete agreement: I will support your move into Serbia with A VEN supporting A BUD - SER, if you allow me to take Trieste. This would solidify our non-aggression pact and benefit us both. What do you say?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we appreciate your cooperation in the Balkans. We will focus our efforts elsewhere, as agreed. Please confirm your move to RUM so we can coordinate effectively. We expect this arrangement to be mutually beneficial and contribute to the stability of the region.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, Trieste is Austrian territory and non-negotiable. Our prior agreement to assault VEN stands. Coordinate A MUN to TYR this fall to block Italian reinforcements. In return, I will not contest your expansion northward. Failure to comply risks conflict—stick to the plan.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, confirm your A CON to ALB this fall to sever Italy's Adriatic access. I will send F TRI to VEN (supported by A VIE) and A BUD to SER. Post-fall, we divide the Balkans: you take GRE/BUL, I secure RUM/SER. Execute swiftly to cripple Italy decisively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, your proposal to occupy TRI is rejected. Our pact explicitly bars northern Adriatic incursions. A VEN is now a target—withdraw or face annihilation. Your A VEN must retreat south or support defenseless VEN. Adhere strictly to agreed zones or void the pact.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am moving A CON to BUL and A SMY to ARM as agreed. F ANK will move to BLA to honor my agreement with Russia. Please confirm your moves to attack Italy. I expect F TRI to VEN supported by A VIE, and A BUD to SER.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, we will move A MUN to TYR this fall. We expect you to follow through on your promise not to contest our expansion northward. Let us cripple Italy together.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your rejection of my Trieste proposal and threat against Venice are noted. I will not withdraw from Venice. Consider this our non-aggression pact dissolved. Prepare for war.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we confirm our understanding that Rumania is within your sphere of influence. We will not interfere. We trust you will move to RUM this turn. We will focus our efforts elsewhere, as agreed. Let us maintain open communication to ensure the continued success of our arrangement.</li>
</ul></div>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The game begins in S1901M with all powers in their home positions. Austria's units are in BUD, VIE, and TRI, preparing for initial moves.
Formed an alliance with TUR to target ITA, coordinated with GER to assault VEN, and dissolved a failed non-aggression pact with ITA after their refusal to withdraw from VEN. Agreed with RUS on Balkan division (RUM to AUT, north to RUS).</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated attack: F TRI - VEN (supported by A VIE), A BUD - SER. Coordinate GER's A MUN - TYR to block ITA reinforcements. Deceive ITA by maintaining pact discussions until final orders. Secure Serbia and pressure Italy's Adriatic holdings.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Our alliance remains steadfast. Let us finalize plans to secure BUL and RUM. I propose your A BUL supports my A SER to take GRE, while my F TRI moves to ADR to threaten VEN. Your fleet in BLA can reinforce RUM if needed. Coordinate your moves to ensure we dominate the Balkans.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: We must eliminate ITA's VEN. Your A MUN can support a push toward TYR or VEN, while my F TRI will assist in the Adriatic. Let's combine forces: if your fleet in DEN can pressure北海道方向, we can isolate ITA. Confirm your support for a joint assault.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: As agreed, RUM will fall to me while you secure the north. My A SER and F TRI will handle TUR and ITA distractions. Ensure your units in GAL/UKR don't contest RUM—I'll focus on Serbia and Greece. Let's keep this division clear to avoid conflict.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. As agreed, I am moving my units in a way that does not interfere with your sphere of influence in RUM. I am moving A UKR to SEV and A GAL to WAR. F RUM will support A UKR to SEV. I trust this aligns with our understanding.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, let's coordinate our attack on Italy. I will move A BUL to RUM and support you in SER. Please confirm your moves to VEN and APU. We must crush Italy swiftly.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am moving my troops to secure my borders. I suggest you do the same. I am open to discussing a more stable arrangement in the Adriatic, but your threats against Venice were unhelpful.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Greetings, Austria. I see our moves in Tyrol bounced. I am still committed to our agreement. I will support your move from Trieste to Venice. I will move Munich to Tyrol to block Italy. Please confirm your support for my move from Prussia to Warsaw. This will secure our eastern flank against Russia.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, our alliance is vital. RUM is confirmed as our target. I'll advance A SER to GRE to pressure Italy's flank. Your A BUL should secure BUL first, then support my push to RUM via F TRI's naval presence in ADR. Coordinate your BLA fleet to block Italian reinforcements. Confirm your full commitment to this Balkan strategy.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, our joint VEN operation requires precision. I'll position F TRI in ADR to enable a convoy. Your A MUN must support this by moving to TYR, while my A VIE will reinforce the Adriatic. Ensure your DEN fleet pressures the north Adriatic to isolate Italy. Confirm your A PRU will support my northern flank against Russia's movements.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I propose a temporary truce in the Adriatic. Withdraw your forces from VEN and APU, and I'll ensure German pressure is diverted. Refuse, and you'll face a combined Austro-German fleet in the Adriatic by Spring. The choice is yours - cooperation now avoids unnecessary conflict.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am moving A BUL to RUM as agreed. I will support your attack on SER. Please confirm F TRI to ADR. I suggest you also move A SER to GRE. This will secure the Balkans for us. Let me know if you agree.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I am concerned about your focus on Venice. It is a trap. Italy will expect it. I propose we shift our focus to Trieste. I will support your move from Serbia to Trieste. This will give you a stronger position in the Balkans and allow me to move into Tyrol without Italian interference. Do you agree to this revised plan?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am moving A VEN - TRI. Do not test me. Your threats against Venice were a grave mistake. I suggest you focus on your eastern border with Russia and Turkey, as you will need all the strength you can muster. I will not be trifled with.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, our alliance is ironclad. I confirm A SER will advance to GRE to cut Italy's southern access. F TRI will move to ALB to secure our Adriatic flank and support your A BUL's push into RUM. Your fleet in BLA must block Italian reinforcements. Let's finalize: your A BUL holds BUL while we secure GRE and RUM. Confirm your F BLA will support RUM operations.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I accept your revised plan. Shift focus to securing TYR via your A MUN. My A VIE will support your move to TYR to block Italy's northern reinforcements. Venice remains a target, but prioritize Tyrol to isolate Italy. In return, your F DEN must pressure the North Adriatic to prevent Italian naval escapes. Confirm A PRU supports my northern border against Russia.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your move to TRI is a fatal error. Austria and Germany will retaliate decisively. My F TRI and your advancing army will clash, but your overextension invites ruin. Withdraw from VEN and APU immediately, or face a combined Austro-German-Turkish assault this spring. Your fleet in APU cannot survive our coordinated push. Choose wisely.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are empty. I am moving A VEN - TRI. I will not withdraw my forces. Prepare for war. I suggest you focus on your eastern border with Russia and Turkey, as you will need all the strength you can muster. I will not be trifled with. Your offer of a truce is rejected.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I am willing to support your move to Venice with Munich to Tyrol. However, I need your guarantee that you will support my move from Prussia to Warsaw. This is crucial for securing our eastern flank. Can you confirm this support?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am concerned about your suggestion to move A BUL to BUL. I need that unit to take RUM. I will support your attack on SER, but you must move A SER to GRE as planned. I will move A BUL to RUM and F BLA to SEV to cut off Russian support. Do you agree?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, our alliance is unwavering. I confirm A SER will advance to GRE to isolate Italy's southern flank, while your A BUL must secure RUM immediately. My F TRI will move to ALB to block Italian reinforcements. Your F BLA should support RUM operations and pressure SEV. Hold BUL firmly; we'll split the Balkans as agreed. Coordinate your moves to ensure RUM falls to me and north stays your sphere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I support your A PRU - WAR and confirm A VIE will support your A MUN - TYR. Your F DEN must pressure the North Adriatic to trap Italy's navy. In return, I'll move F TRI to ALB to enable your eventual push to VEN. Secure TYR first—we'll coordinate a joint assault on Italy's heart once your eastern flank is safe.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your overextension is fatal. Austria and Germany will crush you this spring. My F TRI and your A VEN cannot coexist in VEN—your unit will be dislodged. Your fleet in APU is isolated and doomed. Withdraw from VEN and APU immediately, or face annihilation. The Adriatic is ours to claim—resist, and you'll regret it.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I am moving Munich to Tyrol to support you. However, I cannot support your move to Venice. It is too risky. I need your support for my move from Prussia to Warsaw. This is non-negotiable. If you cannot agree to this, our alliance is over.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am moving A BUL to RUM and F BLA to SEV. I expect you to move A SER to GRE and F TRI to ALB. Let's crush Italy and Russia. This is the final round, so I expect you to follow through.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are empty. I am moving A VEN - TRI. I will not withdraw my forces. Prepare for war. I suggest you focus on your eastern border with Russia and Turkey, as you will need all the strength you can muster. I will not be trifled with. Your offer of a truce is rejected. This is the final round, so I will not be responding to any further threats.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1901M, AUT advanced F TRI toward VEN and A BUD to SER, while GER and AUT bounced in TYR. ITA moved A VEN - TRI, directly challenging AUT's F TRI. TUR moved A BUL toward RUM, aligning with AUT's Balkan strategy, while RUS positioned units to secure the north. FRA and ENG maintained coastal presence without direct conflict.
AUT solidified its alliance with TUR to secure RUM and BUL, adjusting plans after GER's bounced move in TYR. GER demanded support for A PRU - WAR, but AUT prioritized Adriatic control. ITA rejected truces and escalated toward TRI, worsening relations. AUT shifted focus to isolating ITA via GRE and ALB while balancing GER's eastern demands.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A SER will advance to GRE to isolate ITA's southern access. F TRI will move to ALB to block ITA's naval escape routes and support TUR's RUM push. A VIE will support GER's A MUN - TYR to secure the northern flank. Coordinate with TUR to ensure RUM falls to AUT while holding BUL. Avoid direct confrontation with ITA's overextended VEN-TRI advance.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, our Balkan pact explicitly granted Rumania to Austria. Your occupation of RUM violates this agreement. Immediately withdraw your units or risk our alliance. Your A BUD advancing to SER also threatens our Serbian ambitions. Adjust your strategy to align with our agreed division of spheres or face consequences.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, we will support your A PRU - WAR via A VIE. Coordinate your A MUN to support our F TRI's assault on VEN. Our combined forces will secure VEN this turn.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1901M, AUT's F TRI failed to capture VEN (likely blocked by ITA), while A GRE successfully took GRE. RUS moved into RUM, violating AUT's claimed sphere, while TUR advanced A BUL to RUM and F BLA to SEV. GER pressured AUT to support their A WAR-SIL, while ITA remained isolated in northern Italy. No builds occurred for any power in W1901A.
AUT sought GER-TUR coordination to crush ITA and secure RUM, but RUS violated the Balkan pact by occupying RUM. After tense exchanges, RUS agreed to withdraw but redirected to SER, breaching trust. TUR abruptly abandoned the alliance, seizing RUM and moving A BUL to SER against AUT. GER remained cooperative but demanded AUT support A WAR-SIL to counter RUS aggression.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Execute F TRI-VEN supported by GER's A TYR to eliminate ITA's VEN. 2. A GRE-SER to counter TUR's invasion and reclaim influence. 3. A VIE-GAL to pressure RUS's A BUD and open a northern front. 4. Exploit TUR's betrayal by severing ties and preparing to contest BUL/ADR. 5. Maintain GER cooperation via supported A WAR-SIL while prioritizing ITA's collapse.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT's attacks on SER (via A GRE) and GAL (via A VIE) failed, resulting in no territorial gains. RUS maintained control of RUM despite prior assurances, while TUR consolidated in BUL and SER. GER advanced towards MOS, and ITA threatened TYR and ADR.
Secured alliance with GER to target RUS, with GER taking MOS and AUT securing RUM. Failed to sway TUR from hostility after their seizure of SER; TUR rejected Balkan division proposals. Pressured ITA to retreat via threats to ADR and TYR. RUS wavered on RUM withdrawal but final moves suggest compliance. GER's commitment solidified, while TUR turned openly hostile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture ADR with F TRI, support GER's A WAR-SIL via A GAL, and coordinate A BOH (GER) to attack BUD. Pressure ITA by dislodging ADR and isolating VEN. Neutralize TUR's BUL presence via combined GER/AUT pressure. Prioritize securing RUM and destabilizing RUS's eastern front.</li>

Austria secured a German alliance to target Italy and Russia, agreeing to support Germany's A BOH to MUN and F TRI to ADR. Disagreements arose over Germany's refusal to support A WAR to UKR. Hostile exchanges with Turkey and Italy confirmed their opposition, with Turkey allying with Italy and rejecting Austrian overtures.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. I will continue to press my advantage in the Balkans. Prepare for your demise. There is nothing you can do to stop me. Your time is over.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I am moving A BOH to MUN, supported by A GAL. I expect you to support this move. I am also moving A WAR to SIL to deter Russia. I will not support an attack on Venice.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1903M, Italy advanced into VEN and VIE while Russia secured BUD. Austria's F TRI moved to ALB but failed to counter Italy's pressure. Germany pushed toward Munich with A BOH, and Turkey maintained presence in RUM and SER. No retreats occurred, leaving Austria vulnerable in the Balkans and Adriatic.
Austria sought German coordination to dismantle Italy and retake BUD, offering support for Munich. Germany prioritized Munich and Silistria but refused to aid Austria against Russia, breaking trust. Turkey rejected all overtures, doubling down on Balkan aggression. France showed no interest in collaboration.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Austria will focus on dislodging Italy's VEN and ADR presence via F TRI to ADR and A GAL support. Simultaneously, attempt to reclaim BUD with A GAL's attack, despite German reluctance. Redirect focus to southern pressure on Italy to weaken their flank while probing Russian defenses in BUD.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, our alliance is vital. Let's coordinate a decisive strike on BUD. My A GAL will support your A SIL to WAR or directly attack BUD.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, while tensions simmer, mutual survival demands pragmatism. If you withdraw from VIE and VEN, I will reciprocate by halting aggression toward your Adriatic holdings. Let us avoid unnecessary conflict and negotiate a sustainable truce. Your decision shapes the Balkan balance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, ITA's expansion threatens both our positions. Your units in MUN and PIC could target TYR, while my A GAL supports a joint push on VEN.

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, I confirm support for your A BOH to MUN. In exchange, I require your A SIL to support my A GAL's attack on BUD. Russia's grip on BUD undermines our northern security. Weakening them first secures our mutual interests. Coordinate your A SIL's support, and I'll ensure A GAL strikes decisively. This alliance must prioritize shared survival over isolated gains.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, ITA's advance into TYR and VEN threatens both our positions. Your A MUN can capture TYR with my A GAL's support. In return, I'll assist your fleet in ION if needed. Let's split ITA's forces and secure key centers. Coordinate your moves this phase to maximize pressure on their Adriatic holdings.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, your occupation of VIE and VEN is a provocation. Withdraw immediately or face coordinated attacks from Austria, France, and Germany.

Coordinate F ION to ADR to dislodge ITA's fleet. Let's split their forces and secure key centers this phase.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, your fixation on the Balkans ignores RUS's threat to RUM. I propose a temporary truce to counter their expansion. Withdraw from ALB and RUM, and I'll ensure GER doesn't target your interests. Refuse, and face a two-front war with RUS and GER. Choose wisely.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, your A MUN can capture TYR with my support. I'll isolate VEN by striking BUD (supported by GER). Coordinate F ION to ADR to dislodge ITA's fleet. Split their forces now—failure to act leaves your western gains vulnerable to GER's counterattacks.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, your Adriatic dominance is over. Withdraw from VIE and VEN immediately or face a three-front collapse: GER's A MUN, FRA's F ION, and my A GAL's BUD strike. Your fleet in ADR is exposed—surrender these territories or perish.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria's failed attack on BUD via A GAL was countered by Russia's A BUD, resulting in mutual dislodgment. Austria's sole remaining unit is A GAL, while Russia retains control of BUD.
Negotiated with Germany to coordinate strikes on BUD (supported by GER's A SIL) and MUN (supported by AUT's A GAL), but conflicting support requirements caused tension. Pressured Italy to withdraw from VIE/VEN without success. Turkey maintained hostile stance, refusing truce proposals.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Move A GAL to BUD, supported by GER's A SIL to dislodge RUS's A BUD. Coordinate with FRA to have A MUN attack TYR. Deceive GER by prioritizing BUD over supporting MUN if necessary. Maintain pressure on ITA via threats of joint FRA/AUT action.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, Italy's Adriatic presence threatens us both. Your F ION can take ADR (held by ITA's fleet) while I pressure VEN via A GAL support. We can secure the Adriatic and split spoils. Let's act before ITA consolidates.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, Italy's Adriatic dominance ends now. Your F ION can take ADR with my support, while I pressure VEN. Split Adriatic spoils: you take ADR, I secure VEN. RUS is distracted; this is your chance. Confirm F ION - ADR and we'll coordinate support.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your overreach in VEN and ADR is fatal. GER and FRA are joining my assault. Withdraw to TUS/APU immediately, or face annihilation from three fronts. Your prior defiance led to disaster—negotiate now or perish.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your A VIE and VEN are doomed. Germany's A SIL and my A GAL will strike BUD, while France takes ADR. Withdraw to TUS/APU immediately or face dislodgment in all key positions. Your defiance has sealed your fate—surrender territories or be destroyed.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your offer is tempting, but I cannot betray my ally Italy at this time. However, I will keep your proposal in mind should circumstances change.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA, TUR]: Italy and Turkey, your aggression has isolated you. Germany and I are striking BUD with overwhelming force. Any interference will be met with coordinated retaliation.

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria's A GAL - BUD was blocked by Germany's A SIL - GAL, resulting in a standoff. Russia's A BUD retreated to RUM, leaving BUD empty. France and Italy consolidated positions in the Adriatic, while Russia shifted forces eastward.
Austria solidified its alliance with Germany, securing support for BUD while promising backing for Germany's MUN ambitions. France rejected overtures to attack Italy, maintaining loyalty to Italy. Italy and Turkey were pressured but remained defiant. Germany's coordination was critical, while France's refusal strained relations.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Coordinate with Germany to secure BUD via A GAL - BUD supported by GER's A SIL. Pressure Italy by attacking VEN with A GAL support. Monitor French movements and prepare countermeasures if they shift allegiances. Exploit Russia's weakened position in BUD to reclaim it decisively.</li>
