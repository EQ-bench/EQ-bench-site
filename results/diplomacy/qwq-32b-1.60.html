<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT to ITA: Let's divide the Balkans. I secure RUM and SER if you take VEN and ADR. Avoid direct conflict between us. Your thoughts? I'll stay out of your Adriatic ambitions if you allow my land grab southward.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: AUT to GER: Coordinate against RUS. I'll support your advance into GAL if you help neutralize ITA's VEN. Split RUS's SCs later. Vienna's army can pivot north if you commit forces eastward.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: AUT to RUS: Truce proposal: I avoid your northern territories if you refrain from GAL. Focus on common threats like TUR and ITA. Let's not bleed each other while expanding elsewhere.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England seeks a period of peace and stability. We are open to discussions regarding mutual security and trade. Let us strive for a balanced and prosperous Europe.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am willing to discuss the Balkans. I have no immediate designs on Serbia, but I am concerned about Russian influence in the region. Perhaps we can find common ground in limiting their expansion.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria. I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am interested in expanding elsewhere and would prefer not to fight you for Trieste. Perhaps we can coordinate our efforts to our mutual benefit. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany suggests a period of peaceful coexistence. We are both landlocked and have mutual concerns. Perhaps we can find common ground in maintaining the status quo in central Europe. What are your intentions for Bohemia and Tyrol?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, Russia observes your position in Galicia. We propose a mutual understanding: Russia will not move into Galicia if Austria does not move into Rumania. This will allow both our nations to focus on other pressing matters.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITALY, formalize our Balkan division: you secure VEN/ADR, we take RUM/SER. Mutual non-interference in Tyrol. Coordinate to block Russian expansion southward. Your VEN advance is acceptable; we avoid direct conflict. Mutual support if RUS threatens either of us.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUSSIA, we accept your proposal: Austria stays out of GAL, you avoid RUM. Mutual non-interference. We'll focus on the Balkans while you handle the north. Any RUS incursion into our agreed zones will be met with resistance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GERMANY, let's form a northern front. Support each other's moves against RUS. Your advance into MUN can be supported by us if you help in the north. Coordinate to split RUS's SCs. Mutual support against their expansion.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal to divide the Balkans is intriguing. However, I cannot simply 'take' Venice as it is already mine. I am interested in Trieste and perhaps Albania. Let's discuss specifics. What are your plans for Greece?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, we accept your truce proposal. Russia will refrain from moving into Galicia if Austria refrains from moving into Rumania. This will allow both our nations to focus on common threats. Let us coordinate against Turkey and Italy.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, your suggestion of coordinating against Russia is intriguing. However, Germany is not yet prepared to commit to such a drastic course of action. We are willing to consider supporting your advance into Galicia, but only if you can provide assurances that Italy will not exploit the situation to expand into Tyrol. What guarantees can you offer?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am concerned about Russian influence in the Balkans, particularly in Serbia. I propose a joint effort to contain Russian expansion in the region. Perhaps we can agree on a division of influence, with Austria focusing on Serbia and Turkey focusing on Bulgaria. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England reiterates its commitment to a stable and prosperous Europe. We believe that open communication and mutual respect are essential for achieving this goal. Let us continue to engage in constructive dialogue to address any concerns and build a foundation for lasting peace.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITALY: Finalize the Balkan pact. Austria secures RUM and SER. You retain VEN and expand into ADR/ALB. Mutual non-interference in Tyrol and Triiste. We will not oppose your move to ALB. Coordinate naval support against Russian advances southward. Your support in this ensures mutual survival.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GERMANY: Mutual defense pact: my army in VIE supports your advance into BOH, while your forces block ITA's expansion northward. Split Russian SCs after neutralizing their Galician threat. Coordinate A VIE - TYR to support your MUN forces. Mutual support is critical.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TURKEY: We formalize the Balkan division: you take BUL, we take SER. Mutual support against Russian advances into the region. Coordinate your forces in CON to pressure SEV while we secure the Danube corridor. Let's exploit Russian overextension.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I accept the Balkan division as you outlined: I secure VEN/ADR, you take RUM/SER. Mutual non-interference in Tyrol is agreed. Let's coordinate to block Russian expansion southward. I will move to ADR. Will you move to Rumania?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England proposes a general reduction in naval armaments. A naval arms race benefits no one and only increases the risk of conflict. Let us work together to reduce tensions and promote peace through mutual disarmament.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany is willing to consider a coordinated strategy against Russia, but we need more than just words. We propose a concrete plan: you support our move into Silesia with your army in Bohemia, and we will support your advance into Galicia. This will demonstrate our mutual commitment and deter any opportunistic moves by Italy. What say you?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, we confirm our agreement: Russia will stay out of Galicia, and Austria will stay out of Rumania. Let us coordinate our efforts against Turkey in the Balkans and Italy in the Adriatic. We must ensure that neither power gains dominance in the region.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am willing to work with you to contain Russian influence in the Balkans. However, I believe that a direct confrontation with Russia would be detrimental to both of us. I propose a more subtle approach, focusing on economic and political influence. Are you open to this?</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITALY: Final confirmation - Austria secures RUM/SER. I confirm F TRI will move to ALB to support your ADR advance. Your VEN/ADR expansion is unopposed. We will both pressure RUS in the Balkans. Coordinate your fleet movements to avoid conflict in Adriatic waters.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GERMANY: Coordinate your A MUN into BOH with A VIE's support. I commit A BUD to RUM while you advance into GAL. We split RUS's SCs: you take WAR, I secure GAL. Simultaneous spring moves required. Your support against ITA's Tyrolian ambitions expected.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TURKEY: Proceed as agreed - you take BUL, I hold SER. Coordinate your CON forces to block RUS's SEV access while I secure the Danube. Mutual support against RUS incursion into Serbia/Bulgaria. Your fleet in ANK can pressure SEV while my land forces hold the Balkan line.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT demands immediate withdrawal from TRI, a core supply center. We propose a truce if ITA cedes TRI and focuses on the Adriatic. Continued occupation will be met with force. Please respond by next phase.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: AUT and GER should coordinate to split RUS's gains. We'll support your advance into GAL if you reciprocate support for our push into UKR. Let's align movements to maximize pressure on RUS.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, I trust our agreement from last season holds firm. I am moving to secure SER this turn. I will also move my fleet to TUN. Do you have any concerns about these moves?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, we appreciate your cooperation. Let's continue to coordinate against Russia. What are your intentions for Serbia and Rumania this turn? We are moving into Bulgaria as planned.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. As agreed, I will stay out of Galicia if you stay out of Rumania. I propose we maintain this arrangement for the coming year. I am also interested in discussing the future of the Balkans. What are your long-term goals in the region?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, I propose a general discussion on naval armaments. A reduction in naval forces could lead to greater stability and reduced expenditures for all. I am open to hearing your thoughts on this matter.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT's patience is exhausted. Immediate withdrawal from TRI is non-negotiable. Failure to vacate by next phase will trigger a joint offensive via VIE and ALB. We propose a truce if you cede TRI and focus on TUN/ADR while we secure the Balkans core. Your current occupation violates our prior understanding and risks war.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Confirm support for your A SIL - WAR via A VIE's backing. In return, we require support for A RUM - UKR and coordination to split RUS's gains. Propose A VIE - GAL after securing TRI to pressure MOS. Mutual support ensures maximal RUS attrition.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Proceed with BUL occupation as agreed. AUT secures SER via A RUM - SER. We request naval coordination in the Aegeian to block ITA's ION fleet. Any ITA incursion into our agreed zones will be met with joint military response. Confirm your BLA movements to align with our RUM-SER push.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I agree to support your move into UKR if you support my move into WAR. I will order A SIL - WAR. Please confirm your support from GAL to UKR. Let's crush Russia together.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, we agree to the division of BUL and SER. We are moving into Bulgaria. Can you confirm your move into Serbia? Let's coordinate our support to ensure success and then focus on Russia.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your demand for Trieste is noted. However, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial solution. I propose we maintain the status quo for now. I will not attack Vienna or Budapest, and you will not attack Rome or Venice. Let us focus on containing Russia and Turkey. I am willing to discuss Tyrol further, but Trieste is non-negotiable at this time.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, I reiterate my proposal for a general discussion on naval armaments. The current naval build-up is unsustainable and benefits no one. I believe a reduction in naval forces would lead to greater stability and reduced expenditures for all. I am open to hearing specific proposals on how to achieve this.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT to ITA: TRI is non-negotiable. Your army must vacate immediately. We will move A VIE - TRI and F ALB to contest ION, with GER's support. Continued occupation risks a three-front war. Accept our terms or face coordinated opposition from GER and TUR. Focus on TUN/ADR instead of our core territories.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: AUT to GER: Confirm A VIE supports your A SIL - WAR. In return, we'll secure GAL via A RUM - UKR and pressure SEV. Let's split RUS's gains: you take WAR, we take UKR. We'll handle ITA's defiance in TRI to free your forces for eastern advances.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: AUT to TUR: Proceed with BUL/SER division as agreed. We move A RUM - SER, you take BUL. Coordinate F ALB and your BLA fleet to block ITA's ION expansion. Any ITA aggression against our agreed zones will be met with joint naval action. Let's pressure RUS from both flanks next phase.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, we are proceeding with the occupation of Bulgaria. We will support your move into Serbia. We cannot commit to naval coordination in the Aegean Sea at this time. Our priority is securing the Black Sea. What are your specific concerns regarding Italy's fleet in the Ionian Sea?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I confirm A SIL - WAR and expect your support from GAL to UKR. I will also support A RUM - UKR. After securing WAR, I will consider A SIL to MOS. Let's focus on eliminating Russia first. Do you agree to these terms?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are noted. However, I will not be bullied. Trieste is strategically vital to Italy, and I will defend it. I propose a different solution: I will support your expansion into Serbia and Rumania if you allow me to consolidate my position in Greece and North Africa. This benefits both of us by securing our respective spheres of influence. Consider this a final offer.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT's patience has ended. Immediate withdrawal from TRI is mandatory. Failure to vacate by next phase will trigger a joint offensive from AUT (A VIE - TRI), GER (via GAL support), and TUR (A BUL pressure). Your fleet in ION is vulnerable to our F ALB and TUR's BLA units. Redirect to TUN/ADR or face war on three fronts. TRI is non-negotiable.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Confirm A VIE supports your A SIL - WAR. In return, GER must support A RUM - UKR and allow AUT control of UKR/RUM. Post-RUS collapse, GER takes WAR/MUK, AUT secures GAL/UKR. Execute coordinated strikes on SEV/UKR this phase. GER's success in WAR ensures our mutual survival.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Proceed with BUL occupation. AUT secures SER via A RUM - SER. Use your BLA fleet to block ITA's ION expansion. We will support your move into GRE to pressure ITA's Adriatic ambitions. Any ITA aggression against our agreed zones will trigger joint naval action. Coordinate F ALB (AUT) and your BLA fleet to isolate ITA's ION fleet.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are empty. I will not yield Trieste. I am moving A TRI to SER. Prepare for war. I will also move F ION to TUN.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I am moving A SIL - WAR. Please support from GAL to UKR. I am also supporting A RUM - UKR. Let's eliminate Russia. I trust you will support my move.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, we are proceeding with the occupation of Bulgaria. We will not commit to naval coordination in the Aegean Sea. We are concerned about Russia's move into Rumania. We suggest you focus on Serbia and prepare for a potential conflict with Russia.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1901M, AUT advanced A BUD to RUM, F TRI to ALB, and supported GER's A MUN - BOH. ITA occupied TRI, FRA moved into SPA, GER targeted WAR, and TUR moved into BUL/ARM. Key tensions emerged over TRI (AUT vs. ITA) and RUS's incursion into BLA/BOT.
AUT aggressively demanded ITA's withdrawal from TRI, threatening joint action with GER and TUR. Agreed coordination with GER to split RUS's gains (AUT takes UKR, GER takes WAR). TUR agreed to BUL/SER division but resisted naval coordination. ITA refused to yield TRI, escalating tensions. GER confirmed mutual support against RUS, while TUR prioritized Black Sea over Adriatic involvement.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Take TRI via A VIE - TRI, secure SER via A RUM - SER, and use F ALB to challenge ITA's ION fleet. Coordinate with GER to support A SIL - WAR and split RUS's territories. Pressure ITA via TUR's BLA fleet and prepare for potential war. Avoid RUS incursion into UKR by supporting from RUM. Deceive ITA by feigning openness to TUN/ADR concessions while mobilizing allies against them.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Italy refused to withdraw from TRI/VEN, instead attacking VIE via TYR. Germany and Turkey confirmed military coordination against Russia, with Turkey moving BUL into RUM. Italy escalated tensions by threatening direct assaults on Austrian territories.
Failed to compel Italian withdrawal, solidified anti-Russian pact with Germany (splitting WAR/GAL) and Balkan division with Turkey (RUM/BUL). Threatened joint GER/AUT land assault on Italy while securing naval dominance in GRE/ION. Italy's last stand at TYR/VIE forces military resolution.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A VIE supports GER's A WAR - GAL; A TRI captures TYR to block Italian advance; A SER secures RUM with TUR support; F ALB seizes GRE to isolate ITA's fleet. Coordinate with GER to split Russian SCs, crush Italy's land forces, and enforce Balkan dominance.</li>

ITA defied by moving A TRI to BUD and A VEN to TYR, threatening AUT's core. TUR diverged from plan by targeting GRE instead of RUM, creating friction. RUS openly declared hostility over RUM claims. GER remained aligned but focused on GAL/WAR. FRA/ENG focused on GER's Dutch actions, not directly impacting AUT's Balkan plans.
AUT maintained alliance with GER/TUR despite TUR's shift to target GRE instead of RUM. ITA refused all truces, escalating tensions. GER confirmed support for AUT's RUM push. TUR's conflicting moves to GRE forced ad-hoc coordination. RUS's hostility solidified after AUT's RUM claim. ENG's anti-GER stance didn't directly affect AUT's core strategy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A ALB - GRE (sup by A SER), A VIE supports GER's A WAR-GAL. Coordinate with TUR to blockade ITA's Adriatic via F BLA. Secure RUM via A SER next turn. Attack ITA's A TRI (now in BUD) with GER/TUR support. Prioritize splitting ITA's Adriatic holdings (AUT takes TRI, TUR secures BUL). Deceive RUS by delaying full RUM invasion until TUR secures GRE.

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, our shared interest in crushing ITA's Adriatic ambitions is clear. AUT proposes a coordinated strike: Your A BOH supports our A BUD - RUM, while we assist your push into GAL. Split spoils SCs (RUM to AUT, GAL to GER). Simultaneous moves S1905M: A BUD - RUM (supported by A SER), A ALB - TRI. Your A WAR can threaten MOS to divert RUS. Reply by turn 2.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, your occupation of TRI and RUM violates our mutual Balkan accords. Withdraw immediately or face joint action with TUR and GER. We propose a mediated truce: Cede TRI/RUM, and we'll acknowledge your claims in ADR. Failure to comply will trigger a land/sea blockade. Respond by turn 2.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR: We observe your interest in BUL. AUT offers a temporary pact: Support our A ALB - GRE while we secure RUM. In exchange, you may claim BUL unopposed. This weakens ITA's Adriatic flank and secures our southern borders. Your F CON can block ITA's ION fleet. Reply by turn 2.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Austria, your occupation of Rumania is a direct affront to Russia. Withdraw your forces immediately, or face the consequences. Your alliance with Turkey will be your undoing.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: England will not tolerate the violation of neutral territories. We call for a general conference to discuss the future of Belgium and Holland. Until then, we will take all necessary measures to protect our interests.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, I am concerned about your expansion into Budapest. It destabilizes the Balkans. I will move A GRE to BUL to secure my border. I suggest we focus on containing Russia and Italy before turning on each other. What are your intentions in Rumania?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Italy is a force to be reckoned with. I will not be bullied or intimidated. I will continue to expand my influence and secure my rightful place in the Mediterranean. Those who stand in my way will be crushed.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, your A BUL can support our A BUD - RUM. In exchange, we'll cede BUL to you permanently. This weakens ITA's Adriatic flank. We'll coordinate A ALB - TRI simultaneously. Your F CON can blockade ITA's ION fleet to ensure success.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, your days in RUM and TRI are numbered. GER's A BOH and TUR's A BUL will support our assault. Withdraw immediately or face a three-front invasion: A BUD - RUM (supported by GER/TUR), A ALB - TRI, and TUR's F CON cutting your supply lines. Your fleet in ION is isolated.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: The situation in the Low Countries is rapidly escalating. France and Germany have both demonstrated a willingness to disregard international law and pursue their own selfish interests. England will not allow this to stand.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT retook BUD via A TRI support, but faces ITA's counterplay (A BUD - RUM, A VIE - TRI). ITA resisted via A ROM - SER and A APU - ALB. GER supported AUT's RUM push in exchange for GAL. TUR moved A GRE - BUL, conflicting with AUT's Balkan plans. RUS advanced into GAL, threatening AUT's northern flank. ENG and FRA focused on Low Countries disputes.
AUT forged a GER alliance to crush ITA (ceding GAL), RUM), but TUR refused Balkan coordination, insisting on BUL control. ITA rejected all terms, declaring war. GER fully committed to joint strikes. RUS and ENG escalated threats against AUT's borders.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute GER pact: A BUD - RUM (supported by GER's A BOH), A ALB - TRI to seize ITA's SC. A SER supports BUD's advance. Counter TUR's BUL push via naval support from ENG/GER if possible. Hold RUS in GAL via diplomatic pressure. Declare open war on ITA/TUR if necessary.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I will support A RUM - GAL with A SIL. A WAR will move to GAL. Secure TRI as agreed. We must crush Russia and Italy together. I expect your full cooperation. I will not target BUL. Focus on GAL and TRI.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1905M, Austria captured RUM via supported advance from BUD, advanced ALB to GRE, and faced resistance from Italy (occupying TRI/VEN) and Turkey (defending BUL). Germany cooperated via A SIL support and WAR attacks, while Russia retreated to MOS/WAR. Italy and Turkey rejected Austrian territorial claims, escalating hostilities.
Austria finalized alliance with Germany to split spoils (GER takes WAR, AUT take GAL/BUL/TRI), but Italy and Turkey refused concessions. Germany reaffirmed support, while Italy and Turkey escalated threats. England sought neutrality, but Austria ignored overtures.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute GER alliance: A RUM- GAL (supported by A BUD and GER's A SIL), A ALB- TRI, A BUD supports GAL push. Deceive Italy by feigning focus on Russia while securing TRI. Push A RUM towards BUL to counter Turkey. Threaten TUR via GER's Eastern front coordination.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1906M, Austria executed coordinated attacks with Germany against Italy (targeting VIE/TRI) and Turkey (targeting GRE/BUL), but faced fierce resistance: Italy counterattacked Austria's heartland (A VIE-BUD, A APU-SER), Turkey held BUL/GRE, and Russia pressured via WAR-MOS. ENG/FRA/GER's conflicting demands created a multi-front tension.
Austria solidified its GER alliance, demanding strict adherence to the pact (A BUD-VIE supported by GER's A SIL, GER/A WAR-MOS supported by A TRI). Rebuffed ITA/TUR's defiance with ultimatums, while ignoring ENG's peace overtures. GER wavered on supporting priorities but ultimately agreed to key terms. Broken promises: GER initially wanted Austria to support WAR-MOS directly via A TRI, but Austria redirected support to VIE first, creating tactical tension.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute GER pact: A BUD-VIE (supported by GER/SIL), A BUL-GREE (supported by F BAL?), A TRI supports A BUD's advance. Deceive ITA by feigning full focus on TUR while allowing GER to weaken RUS. Secretly prepare to abandon BUL if TUR counterattacks. Publicly maintain GER alliance while prioritizing VIE recovery over RUS support.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, Italy seized key Austrian territories (VIE and MUN), threatening Austria's core. Germany remained a critical ally, coordinating to attack Russia via WAR-GAL. Turkey resisted Austrian advances in the Balkans, demanding RUM in exchange for support. Italy's refusal to back down and Turkey's defiance set the stage for a multi-front crisis.
Austria solidified its alliance with Germany to counter Italy and Russia, demanding strict coordination. Negotiations with Turkey collapsed over Rumania, hardening the Balkan conflict. Italy's belligerence (claiming VIE/MUN) and broken promises underscored their hostility. Germany upheld its commitments, while Turkey and Italy remained implacable foes.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated moves with Germany: A VIE-TRI (supported by A BUD), A GRE-BUL (supported by TUR? Or via attack). Confirm GER's A WAR-G - GAL. Threaten ITA's northern flank via GER support. Hold RUM and VIE. If TUR resists BUL, dislodge their forces. Prioritize securing TRI and BUL to stabilize core territories.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1907M, AUT's units moved to TRI and BUL, while FRA took VIE, and TUR occupied BUL/RUM. GER focused on MOS, and ITA expanded into central Europe. W1907A saw FRA and GER build units, while ITA and TUR resisted retreat demands. TUR's presence in BUL/RUM and ITA's hold on VIE/BUD threaten AUT's core territories.
AUT failed to coerce ITA/TUR into retreating, with ITA and TUR defiantly refusing demands. GER partially aligned with AUT against FRA/RUS but prioritized Russian front over direct support for AUT's VIE reclaim. Mutual hostility solidified with ITA/TUR, while GER's focus on Moscow strained coordination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - VIE (supported by A TRI) to reclaim lost supply center; A BUL - RUM to eject TUR; A SER supports GER's eastern thrust via A WAR-G-A GAL. Deceive ITA by feigning continued GER coordination while prioritizing territorial recovery. Maintain pressure on TUR to prevent Black Sea expansion.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1908M, Austria attacked RUM and CON while attempting to reclaim VIE, but faced coordinated resistance from Turkey (A RUM, F CON), Italy (A GAL-BUD, A PIE, A ROM-VEN), and Germany (A WAR, F BAL). In W1908A, Austria lost VIE to Italy and suffered losses in the Balkans, leaving it surrounded by hostile powers with weakened forces.
Austria's diplomatic efforts to broker territorial agreements with Turkey, Germany, and Italy failed completely. All offers were rejected with hostility, solidifying their enmity. Promises to split the Balkans and coordinate defenses were dismissed, leading to all-out war on multiple fronts.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Hold BUD via A BUD supporting, reinforce GRE with A BUL, and defend VIE via A TRI. Deceive Germany by suggesting support for their advance into MOS while secretly coordinating with France to flank their northern armies. Feign a truce with Italy to mislead their focus, while using A SER to counter Turkish advances in the Balkans.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your offer is tempting, but I do not trust you. Your desperation is evident. I will not betray my ally for a fleeting advantage. Focus on your own survival, and perhaps one day, we can discuss terms. But for now, you are on your own.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Austria, Russia, I am prepared to move forward with our alliance against Italy and Germany. Austria, I accept your offer of MAR and TUN.

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your desperation is showing. You offer Bulgaria and Sevastopol for my withdrawal from Rumania? A pathetic attempt to buy time. I will take Bulgaria and Sevastopol regardless. However, I am willing to consider a temporary alliance against Italy, but only if you commit to a coordinated attack on Venice.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1909M, AUT attempted to secure VIE via A TRI - VIE (blocked, as units remain in TRI), captured RUM from TUR, and faced ITA's A GAL - BUD (AUT retained BUD). GER pressured AUT to support their WAR-GAL advance, while TUR rejected all deals and declared war. FRA rejected alliance proposals, maintaining control of VIE and VIE-supporting units.
TUR rebuffed all overtures, escalating hostility. GER enforced compliance via threats, extracting AUT support for WAR-GAL in exchange for VIE access. ENG agreed to an Adriatic alliance: AUT cedes MAR/TUN for ENG naval support against ITA. FRA remained adversarial, while TUR's ultimatums solidified enmity. GER's conditional support created fragile dependency.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Execute GER pact: support GER's WAR-GAL via A BUD S A WAR-GAL, enabling VIE capture. 2. Coordinate with ENG: confirm F MAO/HEL blockades ITA's Adriatic supply. 3. Defend RUM from TUR counterattacks via A RUM - VIE (if possible) or fortify BUL. 4. Move A TRI to support VIE assault. 5. Declare open war on TUR by A RUM - BUL to contest TUR's SEV advance. Secretly prepare to betray GER post-VIE capture.</li>

Germany reneged on support for Vienna, demanding immediate territorial concessions instead. England reaffirmed support for Vienna with naval assistance, while Turkey rejected truce terms. Germany's betrayal and Italy's TRI assault necessitate defensive shifts.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To AUT, I am not withdrawing from Sevastopol. Your threats are meaningless. I will not cede Sevastopol for Bulgaria. I will consider supporting your move into Bulgaria if you support my move into Greece. I need your specific orders. I will not be bullied.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I am moving A UKR to SEV. I am moving F KIE to DEN. I expect you to secure RUM. I need to see more aggressive action from you. What are your plans for this turn beyond RUM, and how will they directly benefit Germany's strategic goals? I need concrete plans, not just aspirations.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria attempted to advance into SEV and VEN but faced Turkish resistance in RUM and Italian counterplay in VEN. ENG's naval support faltered against FRA's defenses, while GER's push into SEV threatened Austrian-Romanian holdings. TUR's failed assault on RUM left the region contested.
Secured ENG's naval support for Adriatic offensives while secretly planning to exploit post-victory SC divisions. Feigned openness to TUR concessions to mask an impending BUL assault. Threatened GER with RUS alliances to pressure their SEV ambitions, though GER remains uncooperative. Deceptive offers to TUR delayed their reinforcements, buying time for coordinated strikes.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A TRI- VEN (sup by A BUD/VIE); A RUM-BUL to exploit TUR's divided focus. Secretly coordinate F ENG's IONN blockade while withholding plans to seize FRA's GAL post-victory. If GER resists, A UKR-SEV will be met with A RUM-BUL to cut their supply lines. Maintain plausible deniability with ENG while preparing to contest key SCs post-ITA collapse.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1911M, AUT advanced A TRI toward VEN, A RUM toward SEV (clashing with TUR), and A VIE into GAL (threatening GER). TUR resisted SEV incursion, while GER opposed GAL moves. ENG cooperated in Adriatic plans but demanded support in the North. ITA's Adriatic holdings remain vulnerable.
Failed to secure TUR cooperation despite concessions; GER rejected all terms and declared hostility. Secured ENG's naval support for VEN convoy and northern operations in exchange for MAR cession. Broken promises: TUR refused to withdraw from RUM/SEV despite AUT's BUL concession. GER ignored all support requests. Kept ENG aligned via confirmed convoy support and DEN coordination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Conclude VEN conquest via F MAO convoy. 2. A RUM attacks SEV to divert TUR. 3. A VIE supports ENG's F STP/NC - NWY. 4. A BUD holds to block GER's UKR expansion. 5. Deceive GER by feigning weakness in GAL to lure them into SEV trap. 6. Secretly prepare A TRI's post-VEN move to support RUM vs TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1912M, AUT coordinated with ENG to convoy A TRI to VEN, while TUR moved A SMY to ARM to support the assault on ITA. GER and ITA's northern units threatened AUT's flank, but ENG's fleet support and TUR's eastern pressure created opportunities. AUT's A RUM advanced to SEV, but GER's F DEN and ITA's A APU resisted. FRA's A BEL moved into BUR, aligning with AUT's anti-GER strategy.
AUT finalized a deal with ENG (ceding MAR/TUN for Adriatic dominance) and TUR (ceding BUL for joint ITA assault). Agreements included coordinated attacks on ITA's VEN and UKR, with spoils divisions. GER's hostility was exploited by forming a de facto alliance with FRA against GER's northern holdings. TUR's last-minute clarification on attacking via A SMY instead of fleet was accommodated.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's fleets, support FRA's A BUR to secure GAL, and coordinate TUR's A SMY-ARM to isolate ITA's eastern flank. Move A VIE-G-A to pressure GER's MUN. Cede MAR/TUN to ENG and BUL to TUR as agreed. Deceive GER by maintaining public hostility while secretly coordinating FRA/ENG support. Hold ROM against ITA's possible counterattacks.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT coordinated a joint assault on ITA's VEN with ENG naval support, while clashing with TUR over SEV/ADR control. GER continued aggression in the east, and ITA's forces in UKR/BER remain isolated. TUR threatened to withdraw support over territorial disputes, but provisional coordination continued.
Secured ENG's naval support for VEN capture and confirmed MAR/TUN cessions post-victory. TUR's demands over SEV/ADR required concessions, with AUT agreeing to cede ADR/GRE but retaining SEV influence. Proposed a truce with GER to focus on ITA/FRA, though GER has not yet responded. ENG fully committed to Adriatic blockade.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture VEN via ENG convoy, support TUR's SEV push while securing BUL, and counter GER in GAL/SIL. Cede ADR/GRE to TUR post-battle as promised. Maintain pressure on ITA via ALB and RUM forces. Deceive TUR by delaying SEV withdrawal to maintain leverage while fulfilling public commitments. Move: A TRI-VEN via convoy, A RUM-SEV, A GAL-SIL, A BUD holds BUL, A ALB supports VEN assault.</li>

AUT's A TRI moved toward VEN via convoy, while A RUM targeted SEV, clashing with TUR's A ARM. ENG blockaded FRA, and TUR engaged in Black Sea maneuvers. GER's A SEV faced pressure from multiple fronts, and FRA resisted AUT's overtures.
AUT solidified alliances with ENG (+++) and TUR (++), securing RUM for TUR and BUL for AUT. Agreements included ENG taking VEN, joint SEV operations, and Adriatic blockades. Deceptive truce offers to ITA delayed their response, while FRA remained hostile. ENG confirmed naval support, and TUR honored territorial terms.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1914M, coordinated attacks on SEV (AUT's A RUM and TUR's A ARM) forced GER's retreat from SEV to UKR. AUT's A TRI convoyed to VEN via ENG's fleet, pressuring ITA's Adriatic holdings. TUR's fleet blocked ITA's retreat routes through the Aegean, while ENG's fleets isolated ITA in the North. GER lost SEV, and ITA's positions in VEN and the Adriatic were under severe pressure.
Solidified alliances with ENG and TUR against ITA/GER. AUT promised ENG MAR/TUN post-victory and agreed to split BUL/RUM with TUR. Coordinated naval blockades and joint assaults on SEV/ITA were finalized. Mutual assurances against betrayal were exchanged, with AUT emphasizing loyalty to ENG/TUR while pressuring ITA to surrender.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated SEV assault with TUR's forces, secure VEN via ENG's convoy, and enforce spoils division as agreed. Deceive ITA into believing total annihilation to force surrender. Monitor ENG/TUR compliance while advancing into BUL/RUM. Maintain naval coordination with ENG to cut ITA's supply lines.</li>

Coordinated with ENG to secure VEN via convoy and naval blockades, with VEN/TUN ceded post-victory. Resolved TUR's distrust over RUM/BUL by confirming RUM to TUR post-victory in exchange for SEV support. ENG demanded MAR/TUN concessions, while ITA refused surrender terms.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, AUT advanced units toward strategic targets: A TRI toward VEN, A GAL toward WAR, and A SEV into RUM. TUR pushed into SEV and BUL, while ENG and FRA focused on securing northern territories. Coordination with ENG and TUR against ITA and GER was initiated, with TUR contesting GER's SEV presence.
Negotiations solidified a coordinated assault on ITA's Adriatic holdings. Agreements included dividing spoils (VEN to ENG, MAR/APU to TUR, ROM to AUT) and post-victory territorial swaps (RUM/BUL to TUR). ENG and TUR confirmed support for the VEN convoy and SEV assault. No broken promises detected; all allies aligned on immediate objectives.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A TRI convoy to VEN via ENG's fleets, support TUR's SEV offensive, and secure CON via A BUL. Deceive ITA into surrender while finalizing spoils division. Maintain pressure on GER in SEV and BUL. Prioritize immediate ITA collapse to cement post-victory territorial claims.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1916M, AUT's A TRI, RUM, and GAL advances (e.g., A TRI-VEN convoy, A RUM-SEV, A GAL-WAR) failed to secure objectives. GER's A WAR moved into GAL, violating prior agreements, while TUR's A ARM and F CON positioned to pressure SEV. ITA remains entrenched in Adriatic, resisting coordinated assaults.
AUT secured alliances with ENG and TUR to dismantle ITA, agreeing to cede VEN/MAR to ENG and RUM/BUL to TUR post-victory. GER rebuffed truce demands, instead invading GAL, escalating hostilities. ENG and TUR reaffirmed support for Adriatic assault, while GER's betrayal necessitates countermeasures.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute joint ITA assault via A TRI convoy to VEN (supported by ENG's fleets), A BUL/A RUM to block ITA's Adriatic retreats. A GAL moves to UKR to counter GER's incursion and support RUS. A VIE holds to reinforce northern flank. Deceive GER by feigning truce while preparing to exploit their overextension. Demand ENG/TUR uphold spoils agreements.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1917M, ENG and TUR executed coordinated moves: TUR's A ARM advanced to SEV, while ENG supported Adriatic operations. ITA resisted via VEN/MAR, but GER defied demands by reinforcing WAR/KIE. AUT's units held in BUD, BUL, and RUM, positioning for joint offensives against ITA and GER. FRA and ITA maintained pressure on central Europe.
Solidified alliance with ENG/TUR against ITA/GER. Promised TUR control of RUM/BUL post-victory and secured ENG's naval support for A TRI- VEN convoy. Rebuffed GER's defiance, maintaining hostile stance. Negotiations emphasized synchronized strikes on ITA's Adriatic core and GER's Galician flank.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. A TRI convoys to VEN via ENG's fleets to seize VEN. 2. A RUM supports TUR's A ARM-SEV to secure Black Sea dominance. 3. A BUD attacks GER's A GAL via A GAL - WAR, supported by ENG's naval units. 4. Maintain pressure on ITA via A BUL and A GAL to prevent retreats.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1919M, AUT coordinated with ENG and TUR to attack ITA and GER: A TRI moved to VIE, A GAL attacked WAR, A SEV advanced to UKR, and A VEN moved to APU. ENG supported via F STP/NC and F MAO, while TUR pushed into SEV via A ARM. ITA's VIE was captured, and GER resisted but remained isolated.
AUT solidified alliances with ENG and TUR, securing ENG's naval support for VEN conquest and TUR's SEV push in exchange for post-victory spoils (VEN to ENG, SEV/RUM/BUL to TUR). Threats to ITA and GER were unyielding; GER rejected truce demands. ENG and TUR confirmed coordination but TUR demanded explicit cession of RUM/BUL post-victory.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strikes: convoy A TRI to VEN via ENG fleets, support TUR's SEV capture, and isolate ITA's Adriatic holdings. Maintain pressure on GER via A GAL-WAR. Secure BUL to block TUR overreach. Deceive ITA into delaying retreats while finalizing ENG/TUR spoils division.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Prior moves saw coordinated assaults with ENG and TUR to dismantle ITA's Adriatic holdings and target GER's WAR. AUT's units advanced toward SEV and VEN, with ITA resisting but isolated. TUR secured BUL/SC, while ENG and FRA positioned fleets for decisive strikes.
Solidified alliances with ENG and TUR, finalizing spoils (VEN to ENG, SEV/RUM/BUL to TUR). Rebuffed ITA's defiance, while coordinating with FRA to target GER's WAR. ENG and TUR upheld commitments, but ITA remained intransigent.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Conduct final coordinated strikes: convoy A TRI to VEN via ENG's fleets, support TUR's SEV capture, and execute joint GER/WAR assault with FRA. Maintain pressure on ITA via A ALB and A GRE. Secure spoils per agreements while preparing to exploit GER's weakened northern front.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, AUT coordinated with ENG and TUR to attack ITA and GER. Key actions included A GAL targeting WAR, A VEN moving toward ITA, and A RUM supporting for TUR's SEV assault. ENG and TUR complied with agreed strategies, while ITA and GER resisted. ITA's forces in APU/VEN remained exposed, and GER's isolated A WAR faced pressure from multiple fronts.
AUT solidified alliances with ENG and TUR, confirming post-victory concessions (VEN/MAR to ENG, RUM/BUL to TUR). Deceived ITA with false truce offers while planning annihilation. Pressured GER to surrender but faced defiance. Coordinated final attack plans with naval support and supply line blockades. TUR demanded explicit cession of RUM/BUL, which AUT agreed to despite risks. ENG confirmed naval support for the VEN convoy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated assault: Convoy A TRI to VEN via ENG/TUR fleets. A RUM supports TUR's A ARM-SEV. A GAL supports A UKR-WAR. Hold A VIE to block ITA's counterattacks. Deceive ITA by maintaining truce talks while attacking. Ensure TUR secures BUL/RUM post-victory. Block ITA's retreat routes via ION/ADR. A ALB reinforces Adriatic defenses. Maintain pressure on GER's isolated units.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1920R and W1920A, GER retreated A WAR to PRU and held, while AUT positioned units (A RUM, A UKR) to support TUR's SEV assault. ITA rejected truce terms and reinforced TUS/MAR, while ENG consolidated fleets in NTH/ION for the VEN convoy. GER's A SEV resisted pressure, and TUR's F BLA blocked ITA's Adriatic access.
Finalized coordinated assault with ENG (VEN convoy via F ENG/NTH) and TUR (SEV joint attack with A MOS/A RUM support). Promised VEN/MAR/TUN to ENG and BUL/RUM to TUR post-victory. ITA refused terms, doubling down on MAR pressure. GER defiantly reinforced SEV despite AUT's ultimatum.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute SEV assault: A RUM supports TUR's A MOS - SEV. Convoy A TRI to VEN via ENG fleets. A APU and A BOH pressure ITA's Adriatic. A GRE secures GRE/ALB. Deceive ITA by feigning MAR focus while prioritizing SEV/GER collapse. Hold TUR/ENG to promised territorial concessions post-victory.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1921M, Austria positioned units to support Turkey's SEV assault (A RUM supporting A MOS-SEV, A WAR-MOS supported by A UKR), A BOH toward MUN, A ALB securing GRE). Failed truce offers were rejected by Italy and Germany, who escalated threats. England and Turkey confirmed coordination, with England positioning fleets for the TRI- VEN convoy.
Alliance with ENG/TUR solidified with confirmed spoils divisions (VEN/MAR/TUN to ENG, RUM/BUL to TUR). Italy and Germany rebuffed all truce offers. Turkey clarified A ALB's position in GRE, which Austria confirmed. Promises to support SEV assault and Adriatic blockades were reaffirmed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strike: 1) Convoy A TRI to VEN via ENG fleets, supported by A ROM. 2) A RUM supports TUR's A MOS-SEV assault. 3) A ALB holds GRE to block ITA's Adriatic moves. 4) A BOH reinforces GER's SEV flank. Post-victory, cede VEN/MAR/TUN to ENG and RUM/BUL to TUR. Deceive ITA by maintaining Adriatic pressure while securing GRE.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG, TUR]: ENG/TUR: Execute the TRI- VEN convoy immediately via your fleets. I confirm VEN/MAR/TUN to ENG post-victory and BUL/RUM to TUR as agreed. Coordinate your fleets to block ITA's ION/ADR retreats while AUT's A RUM and TUR's A MOS assault SEV. GER's WAR position is exposed - coordinate A GAL with your forces to isolate them from PRU. Joint spoils division holds.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA: Your Adriatic overextension is fatal. Withdraw from VEN/APU immediately or face joint annihilation. We propose a truce: cede VEN to ENG and APU to TUR, and we'll acknowledge your control over MAR. This is your last chance - ENG's fleets are positioned to cut your supply lines, and TUR's forces threaten your eastern flank.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER: Your SEV incursion is a fatal mistake. AUT's A RUM and TUR's A MOS are converging there now. Withdraw immediately or face joint annihilation. Your A WAR in GAL is also exposed to coordinated assaults from AUT's A BOH and ENG's fleets. Cease hostilities and accept spoils division or be crushed.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To Austria, I propose a truce. I will not attack you this turn if you do not attack me. I will move A APU to ROM, A TUS to VEN, and A NAP to TYS. Let me know your intentions.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings, Austria. I trust our alliance remains strong. I propose a coordinated attack this turn. I will support your advance into WAR with A SEV. In return, I request your continued support for my efforts in the Black Sea, specifically with A RUM supporting my A SEV into MOS. This will solidify our control and pave the way for further gains. Let me know if this aligns with your plans.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, Austria coordinated with England and Turkey to target Italy and Germany, but Turkey reneged on spoils agreements, moving A SEV to ARM instead of supporting, while Italy resisted withdrawals and Germany remained hostile. Austria's units positioned for joint assaults on SEV and VEN remain in place, with Italy and Germany counterattacking.
Turkey betrayed the alliance by refusing to cede BUL/RUM and redirecting forces to ARM, breaking the spoils agreement. England upheld their commitments to convoy support and spoils division. Italy and Germany rejected truce offers, escalating hostilities. Austria adjusted plans to counter Turkish betrayal and Italian/German resistance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Secure VEN via convoy with England, seize SEV from Turkey using A RUM and A UKR, attack Germany's exposed PRU via A BOH and A WAR, and neutralize Italy's Adriatic forces. Deceive Italy by maintaining false truce offers while preparing to cut off their retreat routes. Break from Turkey entirely and claim SEV/BUL as spoils priority.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1923M, AUT coordinated with ENG to execute a TRI-VEN convoy, advanced on SEv with RUM/UKR units, and pressured GER/ITA/TUR through multiple fronts. TUR resisted by moving ARM to SEV and reinforcing BUL, while ITA and GER refused to yield, escalating hostilities. ENG and FRA supported AUT's offensives via naval blockades and land advances.
AUT solidified alliance with ENG via coordinated VEN convoy and SEV assault planning. Threatened TUR with joint ENG naval strikes if they didn't retreat, but TUR declared war. ITA's refusal to surrender VEN/APU led to AUT's declaration of war, while GER's defiance prompted AUT to prioritize their destruction. Broken promises: None. Kept commitments to ENG regarding VEN division.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's fleets, A RUM/UKR take SEV with ENG naval support, A WAR/BOH pressure GER's core. Deceive TUR by feigning BUL concession talks while preparing to seize it. Intent to hold VEN for ENG, take SEV permanently, and eliminate ITA/GER resistance.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the last phase, AUT advanced into VEN via convoy, secured MUN with ENG support, and engaged TUR in the Black Sea (A SEV held, A RUM and A UKR positioned to attack TUR's BUL/SC and BLA fleets). ITA resisted demands, while FRA faced ultimatums to retreat. GER's weakened state and TUR's fleet isolation created opportunities for expansion.
ENG cooperation solidified for MUN assault and MUN spoils split, but ENG refused SEV coordination due to TUR alliance. TUR and ITA rejected terms, escalating hostilities. FRA was pressured to retreat, but resistance may provoke conflict. AUT maintained aggressive posturing, keeping promises to ENG but escalating threats against others.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's NTH fleet. 2. A BOH-MUN supported by ENG naval forces, split spoils 50/50. 3. A RUM and A UKR attack TUR's BUL/SC and BLA, targeting SEV control. 4. A ROM and A VEN assault ITA's NAP. 5. Deceive ITA by feigning focus on TUR to misdirect defenses. 6. Pressure FRA to retreat via MAR or face invasion.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, AUT coordinated with ENG to plan a convoy from TRI to VEN via ENG's NTH fleet, while pressuring TUR to cede BUL/SC, threatened FRA to abandon MAR, and demanded ITA withdraw from VEN/APU. ENG agreed to support the VEN convoy but hesitated on direct TUR assaults, prioritizing containment of FRA/GER. TUR refused AUT's terms, escalating tensions.
AUT maintained alliance with ENG through convoy coordination but clashed over TUR strategy; ENG prioritized securing VEN and weakening FRA/GER over immediate TUR confrontation. AUT aggressively enforced territorial claims against FRA (MAR) and ITA (VEN/APU), refusing TUR's counteroffers. Promises included 50/50 spoils splits with ENG, while deception involved overstating ENG's commitment to TUR assault to pressure TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's NTH fleet. Attack TUR's BUL/SC with A UKR and A RUM supported by ENG's naval blockades. Dislodge FRA from MAR via A ROM and ENG naval pressure. Maintain deception about ENG's TUR involvement to isolate TUR. Secure VEN, eliminate FRA/ITA threats, and weaken TUR despite ENG's hesitation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, AUT secured VEN via a convoy supported by ENG, advanced A GRE toward BUL to challenge TUR, and positioned units (A PRU, A BOH) to pressure GER and FRA. TUR resisted ceding BUL/SC, while ENG prioritized containing FRA/GER over direct TUR assaults. FRA and GER maintained defensive postures, with FRA targeting TUR's SMY and CON.
AUT aggressively pushed ENG to support TUR's BUL dislodgement and GER's BER assault, offering MAR/TUN concessions post-victory. ENG complied with VEN convoy but refused TUR/BER involvement, focusing on FRA. TUR rejected all demands, escalating hostility. ITA's VENN cession was secured, but ITA remains hostile. Promises to ENG on spoils division were reaffirmed, but ENG's refusal to engage TUR created tension.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute VEN convoy via ENG's fleets. A GRE and A RUM attack BUL/SC with ENG naval support to dislodge TUR. A PRU attacks BER, leveraging GER's exposed position. Pressure FRA via A BOH toward MUN. Deceive ENG by feigning full TUR focus while secretly pressuring GER's core. Maintain MAR/TUN spoils promise to ENG while preparing to exploit TUR's collapse.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1925M, AUT launched coordinated offensives: A GRE-BUL (targeting TUR's SC), A BOH-MUN (against GER), A PRU-BER (flanking GER), and executed a successful ENG-supported convoy to VEN. TUR resisted via F CON/BLA, while GER defied demands. ENG fulfilled the VEN convoy but refused to engage TUR, fracturing coordination. FRA and ITA remained isolated.
AUT aggressively pushed for joint TUR annihilation and GER dismemberment, offering ENG key SCs (MAR/TUN/MUN) for naval support. ENG honored the VEN convoy but reneged on TUR attacks, straining trust. TUR rejected all truces and doubled down on defense. GER remained intransigent, refusing concessions. AUT's ultimatums to ITA/GER/TUR were met with defiance, solidifying hostile stances.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Secure VEN via confirmed convoy. 2. Finalize BUL conquest with A GRE/A UKR, despite ENG's withdrawal. 3. Overrun BER via A PRU/A MOS support to collapse GER. 4. Deceive ENG by feigning continued TUR focus while prioritizing GER. 5. Hold SEV/MOS to counter TUR counterattacks. 6. Exploit FRA's MUN position for future leverage.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, Austria coordinated with England to advance on Turkey's BUL via land attacks from GRE and RUM, while maintaining pressure on Germany's BER and MUN. England supported the TRI-VEN convoy but refused to commit to direct Turkish assaults. Turkey retreated from BUL/SEV in exchange for RUM/WAR concessions, while Germany remained defiant against all diplomatic overtures.
Austria finalized a fragile truce with Turkey (ceding RUM/WAR post-victory) while securing ENG's support for the VEN convoy. Failed to sway Germany, which remained hostile. Promised ENG control of MAR/TUN post-Italian collapse, but delayed commitments on Turkish front. Deceptive assurances to Turkey mask intent to reclaim ceded territories later.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's NTH fleet. 2. Attack BUL with GRE/RUM armies while allowing TUR retreats per truce. 3. Assault BER with PRU army and ENG naval support. 4. Deceptively maintain TUR truce while preparing to reclaim RUM/WAR post-GERM collapse. 5. Secure VEN to strengthen southern base, then pivot to FRA/ITA.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Austria advanced units toward BUL, VEN, and SEV, with coordinated support from ENG's NTH fleet for the VEN convoy. TUR supported SEV via A MOS and F CON, while FRA and GER resisted through MUN and RUH movements. ENG and FRA clashed over MUN control, and ITA was isolated. TUR's SEV support and AUT's SEV assault were critical to weakening GER's position.
Austria secured ENG's support for the VEN convoy in exchange for post-victory cessions of MAR/TUN. TUR agreed to joint SEV assault in exchange for RUM/WAR post-victory, but delayed cessions risk future tension. ENG refused to fully block FRA's MUN, prioritizing naval dominance. GER openly declared war, while ITA faced ultimatums. AUT maintained deception by delaying TUR's demands while maintaining ENG's support.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated SEV assault with TUR's support to eliminate GER's presence. Secure VEN via ENG's convoy. Attack FRA's MUN with A BOH to weaken their land position. Deceive TUR by delaying RUM/WAR cessions until post-victory. Maintain pressure on ENG to honor MAR/TUN terms while avoiding full naval coordination. Prepare to exploit FRA's collapse for Balkan dominance.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, Austria executed coordinated attacks on MUN with England and Russia's support for SEV. Key moves included A TRI convoying to VEN via ENG's NTH fleet, A BOH targeting MUN, and A SEV supported by A RUM/UKR for the SEV assault. France's MUN was under pressure, while Turkey agreed to post-victory territorial swaps (RUM/BUL to TUR, GAL/WAR to AUT).
Negotiations solidified the ENG-AUT alliance for VEN and SEV operations, with ENG securing MAR/TUN post-victory. TUR's demands for RUM/BUL post-victory were reaffirmed, but AUT delayed ceding GAL/WAR until SEV falls. FRA was pressured to surrender MAR/TUS, but resistance continues. ENG resisted committing F NTH to block FRA's MUN, prioritizing VEN.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Move A TRI to VEN via ENG convoy, support SEV capture with A RUM/AUKR, attack FRA's MUN with A BOH and ENG naval support, deceive FRA by denying truce terms, secure VEN and SEV, maintain pressure on ITA via Adriatic land units, and ensure TUR holds to RUM/BUL exchange post-victory.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Prior moves saw coordinated assaults on SEV (A MOS supported by A RUM/A UKR), TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's fleet, and pressure on FRA/GER via A BOH-MUN and naval blockades. TUR's SEV assault and FRA's resistance in MUN/MAR were key focal points.
Finalized SEV assault terms with ENG/TUR: VEN to ENG, RUM/BUL to TUR post-victory. TUR refused to hold CON, risking ITA retreats. TUR also refused to support BER attack. ENG confirmed naval support for MUN and convoy. Tension arose over TUR's Balkan demands and refusal to block ITA's escape routes.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's NTH fleet. Support TUR's SEv assault with A RUM/A UKR. Attack FRA's MUN with A BOH supported by ENG's navy. Secure SEV via coordinated land assault. Deceive TUR by feigning full support while retaining flexibility on BUL/RUM cession timing. Use A GAL/A ARM to block ITA's Adriatic retreats despite TUR's refusal to hold CON.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the last phase, Austria coordinated with England to convoy A TRI to VEN, while attacking SEV with support from TUR initially. TUR withdrew support after Austria refused to cede BUL/RUM immediately, leading to strained relations. France's positions in MAR and MUN were pressured via A BOH and ENG naval support. TUR shifted focus to AEG, indicating distrust.
Austria secured ENG's support for the VEN convoy in exchange for ceding VEN/TUN post-Italy's fall, but failed to finalize terms with TUR over BUL/RUM, leading to TUR withdrawing support and ending the truce. FRA was pressured to surrender MAR/MUN, but resisted. GER maintained hostility.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI convoy to VEN, support ENG's TYS control, take CON via A ANK with ENG naval support, attack FRA's MAR/MUN with A BOH, deceive TUR by feigning continued cooperation while targeting BUL. Move A MOS to SEV to solidify gains. Prioritize securing VEN and CON while isolatinging TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1928M, AUT advanced into TUR's heartland (A GRE-BUL, A ANK-CON) while pressuring GER (A PRU-BER) and FRA (A BOH-MUN). TUR resisted with fleet movements (F AEG-ION, F EAS-AEG) while ENG partially complied with convoy planning but prioritized FRA/GER containment. GER threatened AUT's UKR with A KIE-UKR, prompting AUT's countermeasures.
AUT aggressively enforced its alliance with ENG, demanding TUR's capitulation and threatening joint assaults. Promised ENG VEN/MAR/TUN post-victory in exchange for naval support. Coerced GER via threats against UKR/BER, while maintaining SEV encirclement with A RUM/A UKR. ENG partially fulfilled commitments but delayed SEV support; TUR defiantly escalated naval movements.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A TRI-VEN via ENG's F NTH convoy. Support A BOH-MUN with ENG's F NAO. A RUM/A UKR to secure SEV. Counter GER's A KIE-UKR with A UKR/A PRU/A MOS. Attack TUR's AEG/EAS fleets via A BUL and naval support. Hold key centers (VIE, BUD) while pressuring FRA's MUN. Maintain ENG coordination for Mediterranean dominance.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, AUT coordinated with ENG to capture MUN via A BOH's attack supported by ENG's fleets, while advancing into TUR's territories (A CON - ANK, A BUL supporting). FRA's MUN unit was surrounded, and TUR resisted AUT's advances in ANK/CON. ENG's naval support was critical for securing MUN and blockingading FRA's retreats.
AUT solidified an alliance with ENG, securing post-victory control of VEN, MAR, TUN for ENG in exchange for naval support. Negotiations with TUR collapsed over territorial demands, solidifying hostility. AUT pressured FRA to surrender MUN/MAR, threatening annihilation. ENG's demands for SEV's post-war division remain unresolved, but immediate tactical coordination is maintained.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Hold MUN with 50/50 spoils split with ENG. Attack TUR's ANK via A CON + A BUL, target SMY/ANK to weaken TUR. Execute VEN convoy via ENG's F NTH to eliminate ITA. Secure SEV/BUL while pressuring FRA to surrender. Deceive TUR by feigning truce talks while striking ANK. Prioritize ENG's naval support for southern advances.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1929M, AUT advanced A ANK toward SMY, A BOH toward MUN, and coordinated with ENG to blockade TUR's fleets. ENG supported MUN assault but prioritized securing VEN/MAR/TUN. FRA resisted in MUN, while TUR resisted ANK-CON. In retreats, GER reinforced RUH, and TUR shifted fleets to AEG/BLA. F1929M sees AUT poised to take SMY via ANK, with ENG's naval support critical.
AUT solidified alliance with ENG for joint MUN assault and SMY takeover, securing ENG's naval support in exchange for VEN/MAR/TUN. Failed to broker truce with TUR, escalating hostility. FRA's defiance prompted ultimatums, and GER's hostility persists. ENG's focus on spoils over TUR creates tension but remains cooperative on MUN.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture TUR's SMY via A ANK - SMY, supported by ENG's naval blockades (F NTH/F TYS). Hold VEN for ENG, take MUN via A BOH with ENG support. Deceive TUR by feigning truce talks while executing SMY takeover. Exploit FRA's weakness in MUN to secure the SC. Deceive FRA by maintaining aggression to mask ENG's true spoils demands.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1929M, AUT consolidated power with units advancing to SMY, MOS, and MOS, while pressuring TUR's ANK/CON and FRA's MUN. ENG's F TYS positioned to block TUR's sea retreats, and GER warned AUT against interfering with their ambitions. W1929A saw no builds for any power, maintaining current unit counts.
AUT solidified an alliance with ENG to dismantle TUR via coordinated land (A BUL/SMY) and naval (ENG's F NTH/TYS) assaults, securing a 50/50 split of MUN spoils. AUT maintained hostile posturing against FRA (demanding MUN surrender) and TUR (ultimatums to cede ANK/CON), while ignoring GER's threats. ENG confirmed convoy support for A TRI to VEN and naval coordination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's F NTH; coordinate A BUL/SEV assault on TUR's ANK/CON with ENG's naval blockades; seize MUN via A BOH supported by A VIE; maintain deception by publicly threatening FRA while enabling ENG's dominance in naval zones; prepare to exploit GER's distraction via their northern focus.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Austria coordinated with ENG to advance on MUN via land/sea assault, attacked TUR's home centers (ANK/CON) with A BUL and A SMY, and engaged FRA in MUN/MAR. ENG supported via convoy and naval blockades, while FRA and TUR rejected truces and escalated hostilities. GER remained hostile, refusing to back down.
Maintained alliance with ENG for joint assaults on TUR and MUN, but FRA and TUR rejected all truce terms, escalating direct conflict. Promised ENG a 50/50 split on MUN/SEV spoils, but FRA's refusal led to coordinated land/sea strikes. TUR's intransigence forced direct assaults on ANK/CON. GER's defiance necessitates pressure via A PRU-BER.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's NTH fleet; A BOH-MUN supported by ENG's NAO blockades. A BUL-CON and A SMY-ANK to crush TUR's home SCs. A PRU-BER to challenge GER. Continue pressuring FRA's MUN/MAR units via A GAL and naval coordination. Deceive FRA by feigning openness to negotiation while preparing land/sea pincer on MUN.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1930M, AUT advanced on TUR's home centers (ANK/CON) with A BUL and A RUM, while engaging FRA via A BOH toward MUN and coordinating with ENG's fleets to blockade TUR's retreat routes. ENG supported AUT's land offensives via naval blockades, while FRA resisted with A MUN and F ION. TUR and GER remained hostile, with TUR rejecting truce proposals.
AUT solidified alliance with ENG to dismantle TUR, securing convoy support for TRI-VEN and naval blockades. FRA rebuffed demands to cede MUN/MAR, escalating hostility. TUR refused truce offers, reinforcing war. Promises: AUT-ENG agreed to split MAR/TUN/VEN post-ITA fall; ENG confirmed convoy support but declined Black Sea involvement. No broken promises noted.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated assault on TUR's ANK/CON with A BUL + A RUM, secure VEN via ENG's NTH convoy. Support ENG's blockade of TUR's sea routes. Attack FRA's MUN with A BOH supported by ENG's F NAO, target MAR via A TUS-PIE. Hold SEV/ROM to counter GER/RUS. Deceive TUR by feigning truce talks while finalizing their collapse. Move A VEN to TUN via convoy, A MOS to WAR for RUS pressure.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1932M, AUT executed coordinated assaults: A ANK advanced to SMY with A CON support, A BOH attacked MUN, A PRU targeted BER, and A SEV/A MOS secured Ukraine. ENG supported via F NTH blockades, while FRA and TUR resisted fiercely. TUR's BUL/EC was under siege, FRA's MUN encircled, and GER's Baltic presence pressured. Multiple battles unresolved, with TUR/GER/FRA refusing truces.
ENG alliance solidified with confirmed support for VEN/MAR/TUN cession post-victory. TUR/FRA/GER rebuffed all terms, maintaining hostility. Broken promises: None; AUT upheld ENG commitments while FRA/TUR escalated defiance. Final TUR rejection and FRA's vow to seize Vienna highlight escalating conflict.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Execute A RUM-BUL/EC with A UKR support to dismantle TUR's last SC. 2. A BOH-MUN supported by FRA's chaos to secure Germanic region. 3. A SEV-A RM (if possible) to exploit FRA's collapse. 4. A SMY secures ANK, while F ENG blockades Black Sea exits. 5. Deceive GER by feigning A PRU retreat to lure counterattacks into traps. Moves: A RUM - BUL/EC, A BOH - MUN, A SEV S A MOS-H, A SMY holds, F VEN (if built) to pressure ITA. Prioritize TUR collapse before FRA regroups.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1932M/F1932M, AUT consolidated control over Eastern Europe, capturing key centers like MOS and SEV while clashing with FRA over MUN. TUR resisted BUL/EC dislodgement, and ENG's F NTH became critical for naval coordination. FRA and TUR rebuffed all terms, escalating tensions.
Finalized ENG coordination for BUL/EC assault (A RUM + A BUD) with F NTH's BLA blockade. AUT promised ENG full control of MAR/TUN/NAP post-victory while secretly planning to retain NAP. Deceived FRA by exaggerating MUN's weakness to force premature surrender, while posturing hostility to GER to mask vulnerability.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Execute A RUM - BUL/EC [sup by A BUD], dislodge TUR's fleet. 2. Convoy A TRI to VEN via F NTH, securing Italian SCs. 3. A SEV/A MOS hold BUL flank; A BOH/A VIE reinforce MUN. 4. Deceive FRA by feigning overextension to delay their counterattack. 5. Secretly prepare A PRU to pivot against GER if they exploit weakness.</li>

ENG supported via NTH fleet blockades, while FRA/GER resisted with counterattacks on MUN. TUR resisted assaults on BUL/CON despite Austria's ultimatums. ENG's NAO fleet engaged in AEG/BLA blockades, but FRA and GER maintained control over key centers despite encirclement.
Solidified alliance with ENG over spoils (MAR/TUN/NAP to ENG post-victory, 50/50 MUN split). TUR/FRA/GER rejected truce terms, doubling down on resistance. ENG confirmed naval support for BUL assault but demanded strict spoils adherence. FRA/GER's refusal to yield MUN led to escalated threats of annihilation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VE convoy via ENG's NTH fleet. A RUM-BUL supported by A BUD with ENG's BLA blockades to capture BUL. Split MUN spoils 50/50 with ENG.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Prior moves saw coordinated AUT-ENG assault on FRA's MUN with A BOH-MUN supported by A VIE, while ENG's fleets blockaded FRA's retreats. AUT pressured GER via A PRU-BER and A VIE support, while FRA defiantly resisted. TUR's A BUL/EC moved to BLA, exposing their home SCs.
Finalized AUT-ENG alliance terms: 50/50 MUN spoils split, ENG secures MAR/TUN/NAP post-ITA collapse. GER rebuffed all terms, FRA refused surrender demands. TUR ignored truce offers, maintaining hostility. ENG emphasized strict adherence to coordinated moves (A BOH-MUN, F NWG convoy).</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A BOH-MUN supported by A VIE, F NWG convoys A TRI- VEN. Pressure TUR via A CON and A BUL to ANK/CON. Deceive FRA by maintaining dual fronts (land assault on MUN while feigning distraction with GER). Ensure ENG's F NWY supports A PRU-BER. Post-MUN fall, pivot forces to dismantle TUR's home territories.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1934M, Austria executed coordinated attacks on Munich (A BOH-MUN supported by A VIE) and Berlin (A PRU-BER), with ENG naval support. A ANK advanced on SMY, targeting Turkey, while FRA resisted in Munich. ENG's F NAO and F NWG supported the offensive, while GER defied Austria's demands, reinforcing HOL. TUR's fleets in BLA were isolated.
Solidified alliance with ENG via coordinated land/sea maneuvers (TRI-VEN convoy, MUN/BER spoils split). Hostile negotiations with FRA/GER/TUR: threatened FRA with annihilation in Munich, demanded GER's surrender, and declared war on TUR. ENG upheld commitments despite minor fleet route adjustments (F NWG to EDI instead of NTH). FRA/GER remained defiant, with FRA targeting Vienna.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A BOH-MUN supported by A VIE, A PRU-BER with ENG support. Secure SMY via A ANK, block TUR retreats via ENG's fleets. Deceive FRA by feigning eastern focus (Russia) while preparing to counter-attack their Vienna push. Hold VEN/CON to consolidate gains. Exploit GER's weakened state to pressure SIL/WAR. Maintain 50/50 spoils pact with ENG despite NWG route change.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1934M, AUT's forces engaged in a multi-front struggle: A BOH and ENG's fleets contested Munich against FRA, A PRU faced GER's incursion into PRU, and AUT pushed into SEV/WAR via Russian centers. FRA and ENG resisted strongly, while GER's A KIE-PRU threatened AUT's northern flank. TUR's BLA presence remained isolated but vulnerable to joint naval blockades.
Alliance with ENG frayed as they refused to support A CON-BUL, instead prioritizing naval control. FRA defiantly held Munich despite encirclement, while GER escalated aggression. Broken promises from ENG (failed BUL support) strained trust, but AUT maintained naval coordination for SMY. Deceptive overtures to TUR masked AUT's intent to seize SMY/CON regardless of diplomacy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Secure SMY via A ANK with ENG naval support, counter GER's PRU advance with A MOS support, hold Munich via A BOH-FRA blockade, and press into BUL despite ENG's withdrawal. Deceive FRA by feigning VEN hold while shifting forces to SEV/UKR. Secretly prepare to betray ENG by seizing CON independently if needed. Neutralize GER's Baltic ambitions via A PRU counterattacks.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1935M, AUT coordinated with ENG to target MUN, with A BOH and ENG's fleets supporting, but FRA and GER resisted. ENG's F NAO and F NWY supported AUT's A BOH-MUN and A PRU-BER, while FRA counterattacked. AUT's units hold key positions in SEV, BUL, and CON, with ongoing conflicts in MUN and GER's core. TUR remains isolated with no units.
AUT maintained alliance with ENG by reaffirming 50/50 MUN split and promising MAR/TUN/NAP post-ITA's fall. Threatened FRA/GER with coordinated assaults, but FRA/GER rejected terms. ENG pushed for immediate cession of territories, which AUT delayed. Deceptive assurances to TUR about BUL/CON while planning assault.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's F NTH. Support ENG's F NAO to block FRA retreats. Secure MUN via A BOH with ENG naval support. Attack TUR's ANK/CON with A RUM/UKR, while F ENG blockades BLA. Deceive FRA into thinking AUT will hold MUN while secretly prioritizing ENG's fleet support. Maintain facade of flexibility with TUR to delay their counter.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1935M, AUT coordinated with ENG to assault FRA's MUN, with A BOH leading the attack supported by ENG's fleets. FRA resisted fiercely, while GER's units in MUN/KIE faced pressure from AUT's A PRU and VIE. ENG's fleets secured strategic naval positions, and FRA's F ION and other units failed to break the siege. TUR and ITA/RUS remained inactive.
AUT aggressively pushed for ENG's full commitment to take MUN, offering VEN/TUN in exchange. FRA refused all terms, escalating hostility. GER dismissed AUT's ultimatums, maintaining open warfare. ENG's conditional support created a fragile alliance, with unresolved tensions over command authority and retreat coordination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture MUN via A BOH supported by ENG's F NWG. Move A TRI via convoy to VEN to claim the SC. A PRU attacks BER to weaken GER. A SEV secures CON. Deceive FRA into believing VEN is ENG's target to split their defenses. Maintain pressure on GER via A VIE support. Exploit ENG's naval support while preparing to betray them post-victory.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1936M and F1936M, AUT coordinated with ENG to pressure FRA via land assaults on MUN and naval blockades, while engaging GER in PRU/BER. FRA resisted with A BUR-MAR and A MUN-VIE, but was outmaneuvered. GER defied AUT's threats, countering with A KIE-LVN and F HEL-NWG. TUR's BLA holdings were isolated by ENG's fleets.
Solidified alliance with ENG for joint FRA/GER containment, securing MAR/TUN/NAP as spoils terms. FRA and GER rejected all terms, with FRA doubling down on MUN defense and GER issuing direct threats against AUT's core territories. ENG upheld commitments but demanded strict adherence to spoils division.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's F NTH, secure MUN via A BOH with ENG naval support, assault BER with A PRU/KIE, and maintain pressure on TUR's BUL/CON. Confirm spoils division with ENG (MAR/TUN/NAP) while preparing to exploit GER's weakened Baltic front. Deceive FRA into believing MAR cession to extract tactical concessions.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT led a coordinated assault on FRA's MUN with ENG naval support, while FRA counterattacked via A BUR-BOH and A PAR-BUR. GER resisted via A KIE-LVN, but AUT's A PRU and ENG's fleets pressured BER. FRA's MAR and MUN remained contested, with AUT holding SEV, ANK, and NAP as strategic anchors.
AUT solidified ties with ENG via coordinated naval/land assaults on FRA/GER, demanding 50/50 spoils. FRA and GER rejected terms, escalating hostility. AUT's ultimatums to FRA (ceding MUN/MAR) and GER (withdrawing from BER/PRU) were met with defiance, cementing hostile stances. ENG upheld alliance commitments.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT advanced on MUN with A BOH and A MAR, coordinating with ENG fleets to blockade FRA's MAO/WES. ENG confirmed support for AUT's push on MUN/BER, while AUT pressured TUR to cede BLA territories. FRA resisted, reinforcing MUN with A PAR, and GER remained defiant, threatening AUT.
AUT solidified alliance with ENG for joint MUN conquest (50/50 split) and Black Sea operations. FRA refused terms, escalating hostility. GER's hostility persists, but AUT prioritizes FRA/ENG coordination. TUR's fate hinges on concessions; AUT maintains pressure to isolate BLA supply lines.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TRI-VEN convoy via ENG's F NWG. A MAR-BUR to encircle MUN, supported by ENG's F NAO. A PRU-BER with ENG's F NWY support. Secure SEV/ANK via A UKR/BUL. Pressure TUR to cede CON/ARM or attack. Neutralize FRA's MUN defenders with combined land/sea assault. Deceive GER by feigning focus on FRA while preparing countermeasures.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT coordinated with ENG to besiege MUN via A BOH and ENG naval support, while confronting FRA's resistance in MUN/BUR and GER's advances into LVN/BAL. ENG held STP/NC and NWG, FRA counterattacked via A BEL-RUH/KIE, GER threatened AUT's PRU-BER front. TUR's BLA units remain isolated but unaddressed.
Solidified alliance with ENG over MUN spoils split and post-ITA territorial claims, despite GER/FRA defiance. ENG confirmed naval support for A TRI→VEN convoy and MUN assault. FRA offered MUN in exchange for joint anti-GER action but was rebuffed. GER's ultimatums were ignored; TUR truce offer pending but unresolved.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated MUN takeover with ENG (A BOH + ENG F NAO support), secure VEN via F NWG convoy, hold SEV/ANK/BUD to block TUR resurgence, and annihilate FRA forces in MUN. Deceive FRA by feigning consideration of their GER-focused pact while proceeding with joint ENG assault. Maintain pressure on GER via A PRU-BER supported by ENG's F BAL.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT coordinated with ENG to encircle MUN, advancing A BOH and ENG naval support, while pushing into TUR's core (ANK/CON) via A BUL/UKR. FRA's MAR was targeted via A MAR-SPA, and ITA/RUS/TUR units collapsed. ENG's fleets blockaded BLA, isolating TUR's fleets. GER resisted but was pushed back via A PRU-BER supported by ENG's F NAO.
AUT solidified alliance with ENG via coordinated MUN assault, negotiating 50/50 spoils split but ENG demanded post-victory cession of VEN/MAR/TUN, creating tension. FRA and GER refused to yield, doubling down on resistance. TUR remained isolated with no response. AUT deceived FRA by falsely claiming 'imminent MUN fall' despite FRA's counterclaims.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute F NWG convoy for A TRI-VEN, maintain MUN assault with ENG support, secure MAR via A MAR-SPA, and advance A SEV/MAR towards PAR. Deceive ENG by secretly planning to retain MAR/CON post-victory despite 50/50 agreement. Pressure TUR to surrender ANK/CON via ultimatum while positioning armies to seize them if refused.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, your defiance ends today. A BOH and ENG's fleets will take MUN/MAR. Surrender these SCs immediately or face coordinated annihilationation. We offer BUR/SPA retreat terms. Resistance guarantees war on two fronts.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, we propose temporary truce talks. Your core SCs (ANK/CON) are secure if you withdraw from contested zones. Let's negotiate joint defense against Russia and Germany. Immediate response by next phase to avoid coordinated assault.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1940M, AUT advanced A BOH toward MUN, coordinated with ENG's fleets for the TRI-VEN convoy, and maintained pressure on FRA/GER via A PRU's push into BER. ENG supported AUT's land offensives, while FRA and GER resisted, with FRA's A BUR counterattacking MUN. TUR remained isolated, with AUT attempting to negotiate a Black Sea truce.
AUT solidified its alliance with ENG through coordinated military plans and spoils agreements, while aggressively pressuring FRA to surrender. FRA refused terms and escalated threats. AUT's outreach to TUR for a truce was non-committal, with AUT privately planning to exploit the talks to isolate TUR. GER maintained hostility, dismissing AUT's overtures.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Secure MUN via A BOH supported by ENG's fleets, execute TRI-VEN convoy, enforce naval blockades on FRA's retreat routes, and maintain dual-track diplomacy with TUR (public peace offers掩盖 military preparations). Deceive TUR by delaying full mobilization while finalizing ENG coordination. A MAR will support MUN assault; A SEV/UKR prepare to exploit RUS weakness. Prioritize 50/50 spoils pact with ENG while maintaining plausible deniability with TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1940M, AUT coordinated with ENG to attack FRA's MUN, while engaging GER over BER and pressuring TUR. FRA resisted, counterattacking via A BUR-MAR, while GER refused to back down from BER. W1940A saw failed FRA-AUT negotiations, with FRA moving A BUR-MAR, and AUT-TUR tensions escalating via land assaults on ANK/CON. ENG confirmed naval support for AUT's land offensives.
AUT solidified alliance with ENG via coordinated moves (F NWG convoy for A TRI-VEN, F NAO blockades), while clashing with FRA over MUN spoils and confronting GER's defiance. FRA's last-minute BUR-MAR move threatened AUT's MAR claims, prompting AUT to double-down on 50/50 spoils demands. GER's hostility crystallized as they refused concessions, while TUR faced ultimatums over ANK/CON.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated assault: A BOH-MUN supported by A VIE; A MAR-BUR to encircle FRA; A ANK-ARM supported by A CON to take TUR's cores. Coordinate with ENG's F NWG convoy for A TRI-VEN and F NAO blockades. Deceive FRA by maintaining negotiation facade while executing land/sea pincer. Neutralize GER's BER presence via A PRU pressure. Maintain 50/50 spoils pact with ENG despite FRA's last-ditch offers.</li>

FRA resisted but failed to dislodge AUT units. ENG's F NWG and F NAO supported AUT advances. TUR's collapse left AUT controlling SMY/ANK/CON. Recent stalemates in MUN and GER's Baltic holdings persist.
Solidified alliance with ENG via coordinated MUN seizure and 50/50 spoils pact. Rebuffed FRA's ultimatums with threats of joint annihilation. Pressured TUR to cede BLA control; GER remained defiant. ENG confirmed naval support and spoils terms, while FRA escalated hostility. No broken promises detected; all allies kept commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A BOH-MUN (supported by ENG F NAO), A TRI-VEN via F NWG convoy, A ANK-ARM (supp by A CON) to secure SMY, A PRU-BER (supp by A WAR). Hold SEV/UKR to counter RUS. Demand 50/50 spoils with ENG. Deceive FRA into believing TUN/MAR are negotiable while securing them via strength. Maintain pressure on TUR via ANK advance.</li>
