<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings Italy! I propose we establish a strong Central-Southern alliance to secure the Balkans and prevent early conflict. I will not move to Venice or Tyrolia if you agree to leave Trieste and Austria unthreatened. Instead, let's coordinate: I aim for Serbia and Greece, you can focus on Tunis and perhaps Ionian. If we trust each other, we can dominate the south and later decide how to expand further. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I suggest a mutually beneficial DMZ in Galicia and Black Sea to avoid early clashes. I plan to move south into the Balkans, not north, and would appreciate your support or at least neutrality regarding Rumania. If you focus on Scandinavia and the north, we can avoid costly conflict and perhaps coordinate against Turkey or other threats. Interested in a non-aggression pact and possible cooperation?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, how about a temporary peace to carve up the Balkans without interference? I propose I take Serbia and Greece, you focus on Bulgaria and the east. We avoid early war, build strength, and later decide if cooperation or competition suits us best. Also, are you interested in a joint move against Russia in the future? Let me know your preferences.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, Russia is willing to consider a temporary alliance against Germany. We are concerned about German expansion into Poland. Would you be interested in coordinating movements to contain German aggression?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, greetings. I am interested in securing my western flank. I propose we agree to respect each other's borders and avoid any aggressive maneuvers in the Balkans. Perhaps we can even coordinate against a common foe in the future. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To Austria, greetings. I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am interested in expanding into the Mediterranean, and I believe our interests do not directly conflict at this time. Perhaps we can coordinate our movements to avoid any misunderstandings. What are your intentions regarding Trieste?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your non-aggression stance. I will not move to Venice or Tyrolia, and I expect the same restraint from you regarding Trieste and Vienna. My plan is to take Serbia and then Greece, leaving you free to secure Tunis and push west or south. If you agree, let's formalize this demilitarized border and consider a future joint push against Turkey or even France once we've secured our initial gains.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I am open to cooperation against Germany later, but first let's ensure peace between us. I propose a DMZ in Galicia and that you focus north while I secure the Balkans. If you agree not to contest Rumania this year, I will not interfere in your northern ambitions. Later, we can coordinate to contain Germany or Turkey depending on how the board develops.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I agree to respect your western border if you do the same. I plan to take Serbia and Greece, you can secure Bulgaria and focus east. If Russia becomes a threat, we can coordinate a joint strike. For now, let's avoid conflict and build strength—mutual non-aggression in the Balkans benefits us both.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, we appreciate your suggestion for a DMZ in Galicia and the Black Sea. However, Russia intends to move into Rumania. We are willing to consider a non-aggression pact, but we cannot guarantee neutrality regarding Rumania. We are primarily concerned with containing German expansion. What specific actions are you willing to take against Germany?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal for a Central-Southern alliance is intriguing. I agree that securing the Balkans is a worthwhile goal. I am willing to leave Trieste unthreatened for now, but I need assurances regarding Tyrolia. I am interested in Tunis and Ionian, but I also have ambitions in Greece. Let's coordinate our moves for this turn. I propose A VEN to Tyrolia, A ROM to Apulia, and F NAP to Ionian Sea. What are your moves?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, your proposal for a temporary peace in the Balkans is interesting. I am willing to consider focusing on Bulgaria and the east, but I am also interested in Greece. Perhaps we can agree that I take Bulgaria and you take Serbia, and we can both make a play for Greece? As for a joint move against Russia, I am open to discussing this further once we have secured our positions in the Balkans. What are your thoughts on this revised plan?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your openness. Here's my counter: I will not move to Tyrolia or Venice, and I expect you to keep A VEN in place or move it south, not Tyrolia. If you insist on Tyrolia, it looks aggressive and I will have to defend accordingly. Instead, let's both avoid Tyrolia entirely. I will move A BUD to Serbia, F TRI to Albania, and A VIE possibly to Galicia or hold. You focus on Tunis and Ionian, and we leave Greece for me this year. Next year, we can discuss a joint push against Turkey or carve up the Balkans further. Deal?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your revised plan risks immediate conflict over Greece, which benefits neither of us. Here's my counter: I take Serbia and Greece this year, you secure Bulgaria and focus east or on Russia. In exchange, I will not interfere in Bulgaria or Black Sea, and we maintain peace. Once we've built up, we can coordinate a strike on Russia or Italy. If you insist on Greece now, I will contest Bulgaria and support Russia against you. Let's avoid that and build strength first.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, if you insist on Rumania, then I propose this: you take Rumania, I take Serbia and Greece, and we agree on a DMZ in Galicia. I will not interfere in Rumania this year, but in return, I want your assurance you won't move to Galicia or Budapest. Regarding Germany, I am open to supporting you into Silesia or Prussia in the fall if you commit to this peace. Let's avoid early conflict and instead weaken Germany and Turkey together.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, Russia is willing to consider a non-aggression pact, but we must secure Rumania. We are primarily concerned with containing German expansion. If you are willing to support our move into Rumania, we can guarantee neutrality in the Balkans and focus our efforts on Germany. What is your response?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree to your terms for a demilitarized border. I will not move to Trieste or Tyrolia, and I expect the same from you regarding Vienna. I propose A VEN to PIE, A ROM to APU, and F NAP to ION. This allows me to pressure France and secure a foothold in the Ionian Sea. Do you agree with these moves? What are your orders for this turn?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I agree to your proposal for mutual non-aggression in the Balkans. I will secure Bulgaria and focus east, while you take Serbia and Greece. Let's avoid conflict and build strength. I propose A CON to BUL. Do you agree to support this move?</li>
</ul></div>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I accept your plan: you move A VEN to PIE, A ROM to APU, F NAP to ION, and I will move A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and A VIE to GAL or hold. I will not touch Tyrolia or Venice, and expect the same restraint. You focus west and south, I secure the Balkans. This sets us up perfectly to either strike Turkey or coordinate elsewhere next year. Let's keep this peace solid and profit from it.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I agree to your plan: you take Bulgaria with A CON, I take Serbia and Greece. I will not interfere in Bulgaria or Black Sea, and expect you to respect Serbia and Greece. This way, we both grow without conflict and can later coordinate against Russia or Italy as needed. Good luck, and let's keep this peace profitable for both.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I will not contest your move into Rumania this year, but I expect you to respect Galicia as a DMZ and avoid Budapest. I will focus south on Serbia and Greece. If you honor this, I am willing to support you into Silesia or Prussia in the fall to contain Germany. Let's avoid early conflict and instead weaken Germany and Turkey together for mutual gain.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I cannot agree to your proposal. I need Bulgaria to secure my western flank. I am willing to offer you Greece in exchange. I propose A CON to BUL supported by you. Do you agree?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I cannot agree to your counter. Moving A VEN to PIE is essential for my strategy against France. I will not move to Tyrolia, but I need to secure my western flank. I propose a compromise: A VEN to PIE, A ROM to APU, F NAP to ION. You move A BUD to Serbia, F TRI to Albania, and A VIE to Galicia. This allows us both to expand without directly threatening each other. Do you accept?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, we accept your proposal: Russia takes Rumania, you take Serbia and Greece, with a DMZ in Galicia. We agree not to move to Galicia or Budapest. We are open to supporting you into Silesia or Prussia in the fall. Let's weaken Germany and Turkey together.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> No moves have yet been made; this is Spring 1901 negotiations. Initial diplomatic outreach focused on securing Austria's borders and avoiding early conflict, especially with Italy, Russia, and Turkey. The goal was to ensure a peaceful opening to claim Balkan centers unopposed.
Italy and I agreed on a DMZ: no moves to Tyrolia or Venice, with Italy focusing west and south (A VEN to PIE, A ROM to APU, F NAP to ION). Russia insisted on Rumania but accepted a DMZ in Galicia and no moves on Budapest, with potential cooperation against Germany later. Turkey initially wanted Greece but ultimately agreed to take Bulgaria while I take Serbia and Greece, though their last message was ambiguous, still pushing for support into Bulgaria. Overall, I secured tentative peace on all fronts, with promises exchanged to avoid immediate clashes and coordinate future targets.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to move A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and A VIE likely to hold or cautiously to GAL if Russia truly respects the DMZ. I will aim to take Serbia and Greece this year. I will not support Turkey into Bulgaria but will avoid interfering there, keeping options open. I intend to maintain peace with Italy and Russia, while watching Turkey closely for any betrayal. I will consider supporting Russia against Germany in the fall if it benefits me. My main goal is a strong Balkan position without early war.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Greetings friend. I propose a concrete plan: I move GAL to RUM with support from my SER army, so I take Rumania this fall, while you focus on SEV and UKR. In exchange, I will not contest Warsaw or threaten your southern flank, and we can coordinate against Turkey next year. This way, we both gain builds and avoid conflict.

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I see you took BUL and have a fleet in BLA. I propose a Balkan demilitarized zone: you keep BUL, I take SER and GRE, and we avoid conflict this year. If you agree, I will not support Russia into RUM, and we can discuss a joint strike on Russia or Italy next. Otherwise, I may be forced to contest BUL or RUM. Let's avoid unnecessary war and grow together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, our peace is holding well. I suggest we formalize a non-aggression pact for 1902 as well, with you focusing west and me on the Balkans. I plan to take GRE this fall. If you want, we can coordinate to pressure Turkey or Russia together soon. Also, please confirm you will not move into ADR or attack Trieste, so I can leave my back open and trust you fully.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, I trust our coordinated moves are proceeding as planned. I have moved A VEN to PIE, A ROM to APU, and F NAP to ION. Please confirm your moves. Let's discuss our next steps in the Balkans. Perhaps a joint effort against Serbia?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, your message is noted, but I see your fleet in Rumania and army in Ukraine poised to dominate the Balkans. I propose instead that I take Rumania this fall with my army from Galicia supported by Serbia, while you secure Sevastopol and Warsaw. This balances our growth and prevents conflict. If you refuse, I will contest Rumania and potentially ally with Turkey against you. Confirm quickly if you accept this division, or propose a better alternative.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your fleet in Black Sea and army in Bulgaria threaten both me and Russia. I propose a deal: you keep Bulgaria, I take Serbia and Greece, and we coordinate to push Russia out of Rumania next year. Alternatively, if Russia refuses to cooperate, I will support you into Rumania this fall to break their hold. But I need your commitment now: do you want to work together to carve up Russia, or will you side with them? Decide fast.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, our peace is valuable, but I see your fleet in Ionian and armies poised near me. I want a firm agreement: you do not enter Adriatic or Greece, and I will not threaten Venice or your southern holdings. Instead, let's coordinate a joint attack on Turkey once Russia is weakened, splitting the Balkans and eastern Med. If you agree, I will leave Trieste open and focus east. Confirm your intentions so we can build trust and plan ahead.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree to a non-aggression pact for 1902. I will focus west. I will not move into ADR or attack Trieste. I am interested in coordinating against Turkey. What are your specific plans for Greece? Perhaps we can divide the spoils.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, your proposal is unacceptable. We agreed that Rumania is within our sphere of influence. We will secure Rumania. We expect you to honor our agreement and support our move. If you attempt to take Rumania, it will be considered an act of war.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I agree to your proposal for a Balkan demilitarized zone. I will keep Bulgaria, and you can take Serbia and Greece. I will not contest your moves.

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I appreciate your agreement on the Balkan DMZ. Here's my concrete plan: I will move ALB to GRE, SER will support GAL to RUM to try to dislodge Russia, or at minimum pressure them. If you want, you can support my attack on RUM from BUL or BLA, guaranteeing Russia loses it. This way, you secure BUL, I gain GRE and RUM, and Russia is weakened. Confirm if you will support this strike on Russia, or propose an alternative. Let's carve up the Balkans and push Russia back together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, your threats are noted, but your aggressive positioning in RUM and UKR leaves me no choice but to contest Rumania. I will move GAL to RUM with support from SER. If you want to avoid a costly fight, propose a real compromise now—perhaps you vacate RUM for SEV, and I take RUM, while we coordinate against Turkey or Germany next. Otherwise, expect resistance. Last chance to avoid war between us.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, thank you for your commitment to peace. I will take GRE this fall, and focus east. I propose we coordinate a joint attack on Turkey next year: you move ION to AEG or EAS, I push north, and we split the spoils. For now, please keep ION neutral or westward, and avoid interfering in Greece. If you agree, we can plan a powerful alliance to dominate the Balkans and eastern Med. Confirm your interest.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am committed to our agreement. I will keep Bulgaria, and you take Serbia and Greece. I will not interfere. I am willing to coordinate to push Russia out of Rumania next year. However, I need assurances that you will not stab me in the back once Russia is dealt with. What guarantees can you offer for our long-term cooperation?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am concerned by your suspicions. I reiterate my commitment to our non-aggression pact. I will not enter the Adriatic or Greece. I propose we coordinate against Turkey next year. I suggest you focus on Greece this turn, and I will focus on Tunis. Let's solidify our alliance with concrete actions.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, this is the moment to strike hard at Russia. I will order GAL to RUM supported by SER. If you support my attack from BUL or BLA, Russia will be dislodged and lose Rumania, giving us a huge advantage. You keep BUL, I gain RUM and GRE, and we carve up Russia next year. This is your chance to weaken Russia decisively and secure your southern flank. Show your commitment by supporting my attack, and I will guarantee no aggression against you in the Balkans for 1902. Let's make this happen.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your commitment. I will take Greece this fall and focus east. Next year, let's coordinate a powerful assault on Turkey: you move ION to AEG or EAS, I push north, and we split the spoils. For now, please keep ION neutral or westward, avoid Greece, and build fleets for the eastern Med. Together, we can dominate the Balkans and beyond. Confirm your readiness to plan this joint attack on Turkey in 1902.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, your threats only strengthen my resolve. I will attack Rumania this fall with support, and if you cling to it, you risk losing more than just one center. This is your final chance: withdraw from RUM peacefully, focus on SEV and WAR, and we can coordinate against Turkey or Germany next year. Otherwise, expect a determined assault from me and likely Turkey as well. Choose wisely—compromise now or face a costly war on multiple fronts.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1901, I (Austria) moved A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and A VIE to GAL. Russia took RUM with F SEV and advanced A WAR to UKR, while Turkey moved into BUL with A CON and positioned F BLA. Italy moved west with A VEN to PIE, A ROM to APU, and F NAP to ION, signaling no immediate threat to me. Germany and England made standard opening moves, and France moved into SPA and GAS.
I aggressively pushed Russia to cede RUM to me, but Russia flatly refused and threatened war if I contested it. Turkey initially wanted to hold BUL and demilitarize the Balkans, but after my persuasion, agreed to support my attack on RUM from BUL, aiming to dislodge Russia. Italy reaffirmed a non-aggression pact, promised not to enter ADR or threaten Trieste, and agreed to focus west and then coordinate against Turkey in 1902. I promised Turkey I would not threaten him in the Balkans in 1902 if he supported me into RUM. I also told Russia I would attack RUM unless he vacated, which he refused. The key promise is Turkey's support for my attack on RUM, and Italy's neutrality in the east.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to order A GAL to RUM supported by A SER and A BUL (Turkish support), aiming to dislodge Russia and take Rumania. F ALB will move to GRE to secure a second build. This should net me two builds. I will maintain peace with Italy, trusting his word, and plan to coordinate with him against Turkey next year. I will honor my promise not to attack Turkey in 1902 if he follows through. I expect a sharp conflict with Russia, who will likely retaliate, but weakening him early is worth the risk.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Our mutual interest is clear: Russia is the threat in the Balkans. I propose a coordinated strike this spring—my A GAL and A BUD attack RUM with support from A SER, while you support me from BUL with your army or fleet. This guarantees Russia's eviction and weakens him decisively. I will not contest Bulgaria or attack you elsewhere this year if you commit. Confirm your support and let's crush Russia together now.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our friendship has held, and I intend to keep it that way. I will not move against you or Tyrolia, and I ask the same. Once Russia is weakened, the Balkans will stabilize, and we can coordinate a joint push against Turkey or even Germany. For now, please keep pressure west or on Turkey's Ionian holdings, and if you can spare a fleet to threaten Eastern Med, it will keep Turkey honest. Let's dominate the south together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: You forced my hand by refusing to cede Rumania and backing out of our earlier understanding. However, if you are willing to withdraw your fleet from RUM to BLA or SEV and vacate RUM peacefully, I will halt my attack and consider supporting you against Germany instead. Otherwise, expect a full assault on RUM this spring. Your choice: cooperation and survival, or conflict and your swift decline.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria, I trust our agreement holds firm. I am moving A BUL to support your advance on Rumania. I will hold my other units in place for now. Please confirm your moves so we can coordinate effectively.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, I trust our non-aggression pact holds firm. I am considering a move into Albania to secure our flank against potential threats from the East. Would you be amenable to this, or do you foresee any issues with such a maneuver? I am also considering a move into Tunis with my fleet. I would like to know if you have any objections to this move.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, your attempt to renegotiate our agreement regarding Rumania has failed. I will secure Rumania. Prepare for war. Your aggression will be met with the full force of the Russian army.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Excellent, Turkey. I will order A BUD to RUM, A GAL support BUD to RUM, and A SER support BUD to RUM. Your support from BUL will ensure Russia is expelled. After this, I will not contest Bulgaria or threaten your holdings this year. Let's finalize this strike and cripple Russia decisively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I strongly prefer you do NOT move into Albania, as it risks unnecessary tension and blocks my fleet's access to Greece. Instead, focus on Tunis and western opportunities. I will not threaten you or Tyrolia, and I propose we coordinate against Turkey once Russia is weakened. Let's keep the south stable and profitable for us both.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Russia is about to be attacked by both Austria and Turkey. If you pressure him from the north—say, moving on Moscow or supporting attacks on Ukraine or Sevastopol—you can gain easy centers while he is distracted. Let's coordinate to carve up Russia quickly before he regroups.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your commitment to our alliance. I will focus on Tunis and the Western Mediterranean. I agree that a coordinated push against Turkey is a worthwhile long-term goal. I will keep a fleet in the Ionian Sea to keep Turkey honest. I am considering moving A TUS to LYO to pressure France. What are your thoughts on this move?</li>

Your support from BUL is critical—please confirm you will support A SER - RUM or A BUD - RUM, whichever you prefer, but ensure Russia is dislodged. After this, I will respect your holdings and not contest Bulgaria or Greece this year. Let's strike hard and fast to cripple Russia now.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your plan to focus west and Tunis is perfect. Keep your fleet in ION to pressure Turkey and prevent him from expanding south unchecked. Once Russia is weakened, we can coordinate a joint assault on Turkey for mutual gain. I will keep my word not to threaten you or Tyrolia. Let's dominate the south together and then turn north when the time is right.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Russia is about to be hit hard by Austria and Turkey. This is your moment to strike north—move on Moscow, pressure Ukraine, or support attacks on Sevastopol.

Let's crush Russia now and then discuss how to divide the Balkans peacefully. Honor this, and we both grow stronger.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your restraint on Albania and your western focus. I fully support your move to Tunis and pressuring France via LYO. I will not interfere in your western ambitions, and once Russia is weakened, we can coordinate a joint strike on Turkey to dominate the south. Build your fleet in Venice if you wish; I see no threat as long as you keep it west or south. Our alliance remains solid.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, this is your moment: Austria and Turkey are about to dislodge Russia from Rumania. If you press on Moscow or Ukraine now, Russia will collapse quickly, handing you easy gains. I propose we coordinate to eliminate Russia entirely, then discuss a balance of power in the east.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1901, I (AUT) attempted to take Rumania with support from Serbia and Galicia, but Russia successfully defended and reinforced RUM with SEV, while Turkey took Greece from me. Germany advanced into Warsaw, and Italy expanded into Tunis and positioned armies in Tuscany and Venice. Builds followed: I added an army in Budapest, Turkey built an army in Ankara, Italy an army in Venice, Germany an army in Munich, England a fleet in London, and France an army in Brest. Russia made no builds, indicating no net gain.
I orchestrated a coordinated assault on Russia with Turkey, who promised to support my attack on Rumania from Bulgaria. I repeatedly confirmed this plan, promising not to contest Bulgaria or Greece this year. Russia refused all diplomacy, threatened Galicia, and vowed resistance. Italy initially wanted Albania but agreed to stay out, focusing west and Tunis, and plans to build a fleet in Venice. Italy also hinted at moving A VEN to TRI, which is a sudden betrayal threat. Germany was encouraged to attack Russia from the north, but no firm commitment was received. I promised Italy non-aggression and future cooperation against Turkey, but Italy's last message signals a backstab.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with the planned attack: A BUD to RUM, supported by A GAL and A SER, with Turkish support from BUL. This should dislodge Russia from Rumania. I will keep F ALB defensive, wary of Italian treachery. Given Italy's sudden threat to Trieste, I may need to adjust to defend TRI or retake it in the fall. My immediate goal is to evict Russia and then reassess based on Italy's moves. I will maintain the appearance of alliance with Turkey for now, but prepare contingencies if Turkey or Italy betray me.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your move into Trieste is a blatant betrayal after our prior agreements. You now occupy my home center, but this is not a position you can hold long-term. I propose a swift resolution: withdraw from Trieste immediately this turn, and I will refrain from a full-scale counterattack and even consider future cooperation against Turkey or France. Otherwise, I will coordinate with Germany, England, and Turkey to crush you mercilessly. Make the smart choice and let's avoid a destructive war neither of us benefits from.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, the Russian fleet in Rumania is now yours, and Italy has stabbed me by seizing Trieste. This is the perfect moment for us to cement an alliance: I propose we coordinate to eliminate Russia entirely, then turn on Italy together. I will support you into Bulgaria or Rumania if needed, and you can assist me in retaking Trieste. Let's divide the Balkans and secure our southern dominance. Confirm your willingness to work closely, and suggest specific moves to crush our enemies.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Russia is collapsing and Italy has foolishly overextended by attacking me. This is an ideal moment for us to coordinate: you push further into Russia—Warsaw and Moscow are ripe for the taking—while I handle the Balkans. If you pressure Italy from the north, especially Piedmont or Tyrolia, we can quickly neutralize him. I am open to a strong Central Powers alliance that dominates the board. Let's discuss concrete moves to dismantle Russia and Italy together.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria, I trust our agreement holds firm. I am moving A BUL to SER to further pressure Russia. I expect you to support this move. Let me know if you have any concerns.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, your aggression in Rumania has been noted. I suggest you reconsider your position and withdraw your forces. Otherwise, prepare for war. I am willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution, but only if you are willing to compromise.</li>

You have one chance to salvage this: withdraw from Trieste immediately and support my army in retaking it, or I will unleash every resource to destroy you. If you comply, I will overlook this betrayal and we can coordinate against Turkey or France as you suggested. Otherwise, expect relentless war. Confirm your withdrawal now.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your message is concerning. If you attack Serbia, you are declaring war on me, which benefits only Italy and Russia. Instead, support me into Bulgaria or Rumania, and I will reciprocate by helping you expand elsewhere. Let's finalize a plan to eliminate Russia and punish Italy for his treachery. Confirm your real intentions immediately.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Italy is lying and stalling. I propose you move A SIL to WAR or UKR to crush Russia, while I retake Trieste and push south. If you can pressure Italy via Tyrolia or Piedmont, we can quickly dismantle him. A strong Central Powers alliance will dominate the board. Let's coordinate specific moves now for maximum gain.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I understand your anger. However, I assure you my move to Trieste was purely defensive, given France's aggressive stance. I propose a compromise: I will support your move from Serbia to Rumania, and you support my move from Trieste to Tyrol. This secures our borders and allows us to focus on France. What do you say?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your proposal is intriguing. I agree that eliminating Russia and then turning on Italy is the most logical course of action. I will support your efforts to retake Trieste. I propose we coordinate our attacks on Russia this turn. I will move A BUL to SER and A ARM to SEV. Can you support these moves?</li>

Let's finalize this now: you support me into RUM, I support you into BUL, and we crush Russia and Italy together. Confirm your exact orders immediately so we can coordinate perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your 'compromise' is unacceptable unless you fully withdraw from Trieste this turn. If you vacate Trieste to Tyrolia or Venice and support my army from Budapest or Serbia to retake Trieste, I will consider peace and even cooperation against Turkey or France. Otherwise, I will coordinate with Turkey and Germany to destroy you. This is your final chance to avoid disaster. Confirm your withdrawal and support now.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, the time is ripe to carve up Russia and punish Italy. I urge you to move A SIL to WAR or UKR, and pressure Italy via Tyrolia or Piedmont if possible. I will focus on retaking Trieste and pushing south. Together, we can dominate the east and then turn west. Let's agree on specific moves: you hit Russia hard, I reclaim my home centers, and we coordinate against any threats. Confirm your plans.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I cannot withdraw from Trieste. France is too aggressive, and I need the position. However, I propose a different solution: I will support your attack on Serbia, and in return, you allow me to maintain my position in Trieste. This benefits us both by weakening potential enemies.

This is the only way for both of us to grow rapidly and dominate the east.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your refusal to withdraw from Trieste is a grave mistake. Last chance: vacate Trieste immediately, or I will coordinate with Turkey and Germany to destroy you. If you withdraw, I will overlook this betrayal and even support your ambitions elsewhere. Otherwise, expect relentless attacks on Trieste and beyond. Make the smart choice now before it's too late.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1902, I attempted a supported attack on Rumania with A BUD supported by A GAL, while securing Greece with F ALB supported by A SER. However, Russia and Turkey coordinated to retake Rumania with F BLA and A BUL supporting, successfully repelling me. Meanwhile, Italy stabbed by seizing Trieste with A VEN, and Germany advanced into Moscow and Sweden, tightening the noose on Russia.
Italy stubbornly refuses to withdraw from Trieste, offering only token support elsewhere, revealing his betrayal is intentional and ongoing. Turkey initially threatened Serbia but ultimately agreed to support my attack on Rumania while asking me to support his move on Sevastopol. I repeatedly insisted Turkey not attack Serbia and instead coordinate against Russia, which he finally appeared to accept. Germany was encouraged to press Russia hard and pressure Italy, but no concrete commitments were received. Promises made: Turkey claims he will support A SER - RUM and wants my support for A ARM - SEV. Italy refuses to vacate Trieste, breaking prior trust. I threatened Italy with coordinated retaliation if he does not withdraw, but he remains obstinate.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to order A SER - RUM with Turkish support, and support Turkey's A ARM - SEV with A GAL, aiming to eliminate Russian presence in the south. I will attempt to retake Trieste by attacking with A BUD - TRI, possibly supported by F GRE or A GAL if feasible, though this may be secondary to the anti-Russian effort. I will not support any Turkish attack on Serbia and will be vigilant for betrayal. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure Germany to attack Russia and Italy, and prepare to punish Italy for his treachery once Russia is weakened. I will maintain a cautious alliance with Turkey for now, but watch for any signs of duplicity.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Winter 1902, I built an army in Vienna, reinforcing my central position. Russia retreated his last southern army from Sevastopol to Moscow, effectively ceding the south. Germany and Turkey both built armies, indicating their intent to press offensives. The board now shows Russia cornered with only Moscow, while Italy remains entrenched in Trieste after his betrayal last year.
I secured a detailed agreement with Turkey: his F RUM will support my A GAL - RUM, my A SER will also support that attack, and my A GAL will support his A ARM - SEV. This guarantees we both gain a Russian center this year, eliminating Russia from the south. Turkey confirmed this plan explicitly multiple times. Italy refused to vacate Trieste immediately, instead offering a phased withdrawal contingent on concessions, which I rejected, threatening coordinated assault with Turkey and Germany. Germany was encouraged to attack Russia's northern centers and pressure Italy in Tyrolia and Venice. Russia sent only threats, confirming his desperation. No promises were broken; Turkey and I are aligned, Italy remains defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute the plan with Turkey: A GAL attacks RUM with support from F RUM and A SER, while A GAL supports A ARM - SEV. My other units will prepare to contain Italy: A VIE and A TRI will threaten Tyrolia and Trieste to pressure Italy, possibly moving A VIE - TYR and A TRI - VEN or holding to defend. The goal is to eliminate Russia this year, then pivot to punish Italy for his betrayal, coordinating with Turkey and Germany. I will maintain the alliance with Turkey for now but remain vigilant for any signs of Turkish duplicity once Russia falls.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Our coordinated strike on Russia has succeeded brilliantly, and now is the moment to finish the job and consolidate our gains. I propose we immediately crush the Russian army in Ukraine: my A RUM will attack UKR, supported by your A MOS, while your F BLA supports my attack or cuts Sevastopol support if needed. Simultaneously, I will move A SER to BUL with support from F GRE and A RUM, flipping it to my control, while you focus on securing SEV and CON. This way, we eliminate Russia entirely, I gain BUL, and you gain SEV, balancing our growth and cementing our alliance. Confirm your agreement or suggest refinements, but let's act decisively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your betrayal in Trieste has not been forgotten, but I am willing to negotiate a ceasefire if you immediately withdraw A TYR and A TRI, ceding Trieste back to me this fall. In exchange, I will not attack Venice or threaten your southern holdings, and we can coordinate against Turkey, who is becoming dangerously strong. If you refuse, I will coordinate with Germany and Turkey to crush you from all sides. This is your final chance to avoid disaster—withdraw peacefully, and we can reset relations.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, with Russia on the brink of collapse, now is the perfect time for us to coordinate a final push to eliminate him and then turn our attention to containing Turkey's expansion. I suggest you press hard on Moscow and Warsaw, while I secure Rumania and Bulgaria. Additionally, Italy is vulnerable and isolated; if you pressure Tyrolia and Venice, we can split his centers and prevent him from becoming a threat. Let's discuss specific moves to maximize gains for both of us this year.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Our plan to eliminate Russia is nearly complete, but I insist on a fair division: you take Sevastopol, I take Bulgaria and Rumania. I will support your A ARM - SEV with A RUM, while my A SER and F GRE will coordinate to take BUL from your army, which you should vacate or support my attack on. This balances our growth and prevents friction. Once Russia is gone, we can discuss a joint push into the Mediterranean or against Germany. Confirm your support for this arrangement immediately.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your refusal to withdraw from Trieste is unacceptable. My final offer: you immediately pull A TYR back to VEN or PIE, and vacate Trieste this fall, allowing me to retake it peacefully. In exchange, I will halt all attacks on your centers and support your naval expansion west or south. Otherwise, I will coordinate with Turkey and Germany to crush you from all sides, starting now. Choose wisely—cooperation or destruction.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, with Russia cornered, let's coordinate: you press Moscow and Warsaw, while I secure Rumania and Bulgaria. Simultaneously, Italy is exposed—if you move on Tyrolia and Venice, I can reclaim Trieste and push south. This will net us quick gains and contain both Italy and Turkey before they become unstoppable. Share your planned moves so we can synchronize for maximum effect.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your demands are unreasonable. I will not withdraw from Trieste.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1903, Austria successfully captured Rumania with support from Serbia, while Turkey repositioned aggressively: moving SEV to MOS, SMY to ARM, and BLA vacated RUM. Germany advanced east, taking positions in Prussia, Livonia, and Silesia, and Italy consolidated in Tyrolia and Piedmont, holding Trieste. Russia is reduced to a single army in Ukraine and one in Moscow, under heavy assault from all sides.
Negotiations were tense and combative. Turkey initially proposed taking both Sevastopol and Rumania, denying Austria Bulgaria, which I firmly rejected as greedy overreach. Despite multiple ultimatums, Turkey refused to cede Bulgaria or Rumania, insisting on taking SEV and RUM while only offering to support a Russian attack on Ukraine. Italy flatly refused to withdraw from Trieste, instead threatening Vienna and proposing I accept his control over Trieste and Albania, which I rejected. Germany was approached repeatedly to coordinate a push on Russia and pressure Italy, and warned about Turkey's expansion, but gave no concrete commitments. Turkey's duplicity and Italy's obstinance have made clear that both are immediate threats. Promises made: Turkey will support A MOS to UKR and take SEV with A ARM, but refuses to assist me into BUL or RUM. No other firm promises received.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to resist Turkey's overreach by holding RUM and contesting BUL aggressively, likely moving A SER supported by F GRE to BUL, possibly with A RUM supporting or attacking UKR per tactical needs. I will not allow Turkey to take both RUM and SEV unopposed. Against Italy, I will defend Vienna and prepare to retake Trieste, possibly with German assistance if secured. Diplomatically, I will warn Germany again about Turkey's threat and seek his help against Italy. I may feign limited cooperation with Turkey to buy time but will prepare to pivot against him. The goal is to prevent Turkish dominance, reclaim Trieste, and eliminate Russia without overextending.</li>

Turkey is overreaching and will soon threaten us both if unchecked, while Italy remains entrenched in Trieste and Tyrolia, menacing my core.

Simultaneously, let's squeeze Turkey: I will contest Bulgaria and Rumania, and you can advance toward Warsaw and Ukraine. If we work together now, we can carve up the east and contain France's western surge. Are you willing to coordinate specific moves this spring?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your recent moves have been aggressive, but I am still open to cooperation if you show good faith. I propose this: you take Sevastopol and hold Moscow, but leave Rumania and Bulgaria to me. I will support your attack on SEV if you support me into BUL from CON or stand down there. Otherwise, I will contest both fiercely. Let's avoid mutual destruction and instead eliminate Russia cleanly, then discuss a fair division of the Balkans. Confirm if you accept this arrangement, or prepare for a costly conflict neither of us can afford.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your betrayal in Trieste has only weakened us both and opened the door for Turkish expansion. France is surging west, and Germany is eyeing your northern flank.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1903, Austria successfully took Bulgaria from Turkey with support from Greece and Rumania, consolidating Balkan control. Italy invaded Trieste and Tyrolia, threatening Austria's core, while Germany advanced into Galicia and Livonia, capturing Moscow from Russia. France expanded into Munich and Belgium, strengthening its western position. Russia was eliminated, and Austria built an army in Budapest, preparing for further conflict.
Negotiations were tense and largely unproductive. Turkey refused all Austrian proposals to cede Bulgaria or even share influence, insisting on taking both Bulgaria and Sevastopol, and threatened war. Italy stubbornly refused to withdraw from Trieste, repeatedly offering only Tyrolia in exchange, which Austria rejected. Germany remained cautious, moving Galicia to Bohemia defensively and declining to commit to joint offensives, but expressed interest in Austria's plans and hinted at future cooperation. Austria issued escalating threats to both Italy and Turkey, warning of coordinated retaliation, but neither relented. No concrete alliances or move commitments were secured, and the diplomatic atmosphere is confrontational.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to fiercely contest Bulgaria, likely ordering A RUM S A SER - BUL or A BUL H, to block Turkish advances. I will hold or support in Rumania to prevent Turkish incursion. Against Italy, I will attempt to retake Trieste with support from Vienna and Budapest, possibly A VIE S A BUD - TRI or A BUD - TRI, while pressuring Tyrolia if feasible. I will keep Germany informed to encourage future cooperation but expect little immediate help. I will not support Turkey into Sevastopol and may consider limited cooperation with Italy only if they unexpectedly withdraw, which is unlikely. My overall plan is to defend my Balkan holdings, punish Italy's incursion, and resist Turkish aggression, while keeping diplomatic channels open for opportunistic alliances.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, since you refuse formal alliance, I will proceed independently, but know this: Turkey is the true threat, expanding unchecked in the east. Once I retake Trieste and secure the Balkans, I urge you to press Warsaw and pressure Turkey from the north. If you reconsider, I can support you into Warsaw or Bohemia next turn.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1904, I attempted to consolidate my position: I moved BUD to TRI with VIE's support, RUM supported BUL to hold, and shifted F GRE to AEG. Unfortunately, Italy counterattacked, retaking Trieste with support from Tyrolia, and now occupies both TRI and TYR, threatening my core. Meanwhile, Turkey aggressively pushed into Bulgaria with armies from CON and BLA, seizing BUL and further destabilizing the Balkans. Germany reinforced Munich and repositioned but did not engage Italy or Turkey directly. England and France clashed in the west, with ENG fleets moving into the Channel and North Sea.
I aggressively pressed GER for a central alliance to squeeze ITA and TUR, but GER refused any formal cooperation, focusing instead on securing Munich and remaining noncommittal. I threatened ITA repeatedly, demanding withdrawal from TRI and TYR, offering peace if they supported me into VEN or ION, but ITA arrogantly refused, insisting on keeping Trieste and even demanding I cede more territory. With TUR, I demanded withdrawal from BUL and support into SEV, offering recognition of their Anatolian holdings, but TUR flatly rejected all offers, boasting of further conquests. Both ITA and TUR are openly hostile, and GER is unhelpful. No concrete alliances or support agreements were reached; all sides are preparing for open conflict.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate goal is to retake Trieste and contain Italy's incursion. I will likely attack TRI with support from VIE and BUD, while using RUM to either support defense or threaten SEV. F AEG will pressure BUL or support a Balkan attack. I will not rely on German assistance but may feint cooperation to keep options open. Against Turkey, I will defend RUM and consider counterattacks if opportunities arise. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord between ITA and TUR, but my main focus is military: reclaim Trieste, hold the Balkans, and prevent further losses. I will not honor any prior offers to ITA or TUR, as they rejected all reasonable terms.</li>

Italy holds Trieste and Tyrolia, threatening my core, while Turkey masses armies to sweep the Balkans. If you want to prevent a southern juggernaut, now is the moment: support me diplomatically and militarily to crush Italy in Tyrolia and Trieste, and pressure Turkey in Galicia and Ukraine. I propose you move BOH to TYR or support my attack on Trieste, while I push south and east. Together, we can carve up Italy and contain Turkey before they become unstoppable.

This is your final chance to avoid annihilation: vacate Trieste, support my army in, and we can discuss a real alliance. Otherwise, prepare for total war.</li>

I propose a ceasefire: you support me into Trieste or against Italy in Ionian, and I will recognize your control of Bulgaria and Sevastopol for now. Once Italy is broken, we can renegotiate the Balkans. If you refuse, I will ally with Germany and even Italy if needed to push you out of Europe entirely.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1904, I lost Trieste to Italy's army from Venice, despite supporting moves from Budapest and Vienna. Germany took Moscow and reinforced Munich, while Turkey advanced into Rumania and Armenia, consolidating control in the east. Italy now occupies Trieste and Tyrolia, threatening my core, while Turkey holds Bulgaria and is posturing aggressively. Germany built armies in Berlin and Kiel, England took Belgium, and France repositioned westward.
I aggressively pressured Italy to withdraw from Trieste and Tyrolia, offering survival in exchange for support, but Italy refused. Germany expressed concern over the Italian-Turkish threat and agreed to move BOH to TYR to cut Italian support, with Munich backing BOH. I promised Germany to pivot against Turkey after reclaiming Trieste. Turkey rejected all cooperation, threatened to attack Bulgaria, and is moving A CON to BUL supported by F BLA. I repeatedly warned Turkey of a united front but he remains hostile. No deals were struck with Italy or Turkey; only Germany committed to coordinated moves.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BUD - TRI supported by A VIE to retake Trieste. Germany will move A BOH - TYR to cut Italian support from Tyrolia, with A MUN moving to BOH to reinforce. My goal is to dislodge Italy from Trieste this turn. Simultaneously, I will prepare to push east against Turkey after Italy is weakened, likely moving A RUM towards SEV or UKR in the fall. I will not trust Turkey and will defend Bulgaria vigorously. My diplomacy aims to keep Germany focused south and isolate Italy and Turkey from each other.</li>

Once Italy is weakened, we pivot east to contain Turkey's expansion. Confirm your moves so we can synchronize perfectly and divide the spoils.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1905, I attempted a coordinated assault on Italy: Vienna moved to Trieste supported by Budapest, while I also attacked Venice. Simultaneously, I pushed Rumania to Sevastopol and moved AEG to Constantinople. Germany advanced aggressively east, taking Moscow and Warsaw, and moved into Tyrolia and Bohemia, but did not cut Italian support in Tyrolia, causing my attack on Trieste to fail. Turkey consolidated in the Black Sea and Armenia, retaking Constantinople and refusing cooperation. Italy reinforced the Ionian and Albania, maintaining a stubborn defense.
I pressured Germany to cut Tyrolia or support my attack on Trieste, but he refused, prioritizing his defense against France and only promising to cut BUR instead. I repeatedly threatened Italy, demanding withdrawal from Trieste and Tyrolia in exchange for survival and future gains, but Italy ignored or rejected these ultimatums. With Turkey, I demanded withdrawal from Constantinople and Black Sea plus support into Sevastopol, but Turkey flatly refused, instead threatening an attack on Bulgaria. Germany promised eventual support against Italy but was noncommittal about Venice. Turkey remains openly hostile, Italy defiant, and Germany opportunistic but cautious.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will persist in attacking Trieste with support from Vienna and Budapest, hoping German pressure on BUR weakens Italian defenses. I will likely hold Bulgaria to resist Turkey's expected attack from Constantinople and Black Sea. My fleet in AEG may support Bulgaria or contest Constantinople if possible. Rumania will attempt to contest Sevastopol or support Bulgaria defensively. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure Germany for more active support against Italy and seek to exploit any cracks between Italy and Turkey. My goal is to break Italy's hold on Trieste, contain Turkey's aggression, and prepare for a pivot west or east depending on the tactical situation.</li>

Your move BOH to TYR will be crucial to cut Italian support and ensure Trieste falls. I guarantee zero interference in your eastern holdings—WAR, MOS, SEV, UKR are yours uncontested. Once Italy is dislodged, I pivot fully against Turkey, leaving you free to expand west. This is your chance to secure the east and weaken two rivals. Let's strike decisively now.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, this is your last opportunity: withdraw from Trieste and Tyrolia immediately, and support me into Venice or Albania. In exchange, I guarantee your survival and gains against Turkey. Refuse, and you will be crushed between German armies and my relentless assault—Trieste will fall, Tyrolia overrun, and your empire dismantled. Switch sides now and profit, or perish stubbornly. The choice is yours.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your arrogance seals your doom. I will attack CON with BUL and AEG, and push RUM towards SEV or UKR. Germany and Italy will be encouraged to join the assault. Cede CON peacefully and support me into SEV now, and I will recognize your Anatolian holdings and halt aggression. Refuse, and your empire will be dismantled piece by piece. This is your final chance for survival on favorable terms. Choose wisely, or be destroyed.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your threats are laughable. I will not cede anything. Prepare to face the might of Turkey and Italy. BUL will be mine, and then RUM. Your empire will crumble before our combined forces. This is your final warning. Prepare for war.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, we will move A BOH to TYR as agreed. However, we cannot commit further resources at this time. We will observe your progress and consider further support if you demonstrate success against Italy and Turkey. We expect you to honor your commitment to not interfere in our eastern holdings.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1905, Germany advanced aggressively: taking Belgium, moving into Vienna, and pushing into Ukraine and Sevastopol. Italy held firm in Trieste and Tyrolia, while Turkey seized Bulgaria with support from Black Sea and Constantinople. Austria lost Trieste and faced encroachment from all sides but maintained control of core Balkan centers. Germany built an army in Berlin, Italy a fleet in Naples, and Turkey disbanded Armenia, consolidating forces for the coming conflict.
I aggressively pressured Italy to abandon Trieste and Tyrolia in exchange for survival and gains against Turkey, but Italy refused repeatedly. With Turkey, I demanded cession of Constantinople and support into Sevastopol, threatening total destruction if he refused; Turkey defiantly rejected all offers, promising to attack Bulgaria and Rumania. Germany was more receptive: after initial hesitation, they agreed to move BOH to TYR to cut Italian support, in exchange for my guarantee not to interfere with their eastern holdings (WAR, MOS, SEV, UKR). I promised this explicitly, focusing on reclaiming Trieste and attacking Turkey. Germany refused to commit further resources but will observe my success before deeper cooperation. No other powers engaged meaningfully.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate goal is to retake Trieste by supporting an attack with BUD and VIE, relying on Germany's BOH-TYR move to cut Italian support. Simultaneously, I will attack Constantinople with BUL and AEG, and push RUM towards SEV or UKR to pressure Turkey. This dual assault aims to weaken both Italy and Turkey, forcing one or both to collapse or switch sides. I will honor my promise to Germany not to contest their eastern gains, hoping to secure their future support. Diplomatically, I will continue to threaten and pressure Italy and Turkey, while encouraging Germany to deepen cooperation if I succeed. My strategy is aggressive offense combined with selective diplomacy to break the ITA-TUR alliance.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1906, I successfully coordinated with GER to pressure ITA and TUR. I moved BUD to TRI with VIE's support, BUL and AEG attacked CON, but TUR countered by retaking BUL with support from BLA. GER advanced aggressively: taking MUN from ITA, moving into HOL, BEL, and consolidating control over SEV and MOS. ITA held firm in VEN, MAR, and ALB, while TUR stubbornly defended CON and ANK. The frontlines are tense, with no immediate breakthroughs but significant pressure applied.
I pushed hard on all fronts: threatening ITA to abandon Trieste and Tyrolia and switch sides, offering survival and gains against TUR, but ITA refused defiantly. With TUR, I demanded withdrawal from CON and support on SEV or SMY, promising Anatolian survival, but TUR rejected all overtures and threatened resistance. My coordination with GER was productive: GER promised to move BOH to TYR, SIL to MUN, and TYR to PIE to cut Italian retreats, isolating ITA further. We agreed to focus on crushing ITA now, then pivot east to dismantle TUR. No promises were broken; rather, ITA and TUR doubled down on resistance, while GER and I solidified our anti-ITA/TUR alliance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BUL and F AEG to attack CON decisively, aiming to dislodge TUR. A RUM will pressure SEV or cut support. A BUD will retreat to SER to free up Budapest. A VIE will support TRI or cut BOH if needed. I will maintain close coordination with GER, relying on his moves to TYR, PIE, and MUN to isolate ITA. My goal is to break ITA's hold on Trieste and Tyrolia, seize CON from TUR, and prepare for a joint offensive eastward. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure ITA and TUR to switch sides or face elimination, but expect no cooperation. I will present a united front with GER, while keeping options open to pivot if needed.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Winter 1906 saw England disband its fleet in Picardy, consolidating forces at home. No other adjustments or retreats occurred. The board remains largely stable, with Germany dominant in the north and east, Italy entrenched in central Europe, and Turkey stubbornly holding its corner. Austria holds the Balkans and is poised for a dual assault on Italy and Turkey.
I aggressively pressured Italy and Turkey to capitulate, offering survival in exchange for betrayal or surrender, but both refused defiantly. Germany confirmed commitment to cut Italian support by moving BOH to TYR and to pressure PIE, but expressed concern about my simultaneous attack on Turkey, fearing overextension. I reassured Germany of my capacity to handle both fronts and pressed for synchronized moves to break Italy's defense and seize Turkish centers. No explicit promises were broken; Germany remains cooperative but cautious, while Italy and Turkey remain hostile and unyielding.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Coordinate with Germany: GER's BOH->TYR cuts Italian support. I will support BUD and VIE to retake TRI. Once TRI is secure, push into VEN with German assistance or cut VEN directly. Simultaneously, attack CON with BUL and AEG to break Turkey's hold, while RUM pressures SEV or UKR to disrupt Turkish coordination. The goal is to decisively weaken both Italy and Turkey this year, securing TRI, VEN, and CON if possible. Maintain alliance with Germany, keep him focused westward, and prepare to divide the spoils after crushing our mutual enemies.</li>

Focus on securing VEN and TRI before expanding further into TUR's territory. I am concerned about your attack on CON, as it weakens us both against TUR. Confirm your moves so we can ensure perfect timing. This is the final turn for moves, so let's make it count.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. I will not surrender. I will fight you to the death. I am coordinating with Italy and Germany to dismantle your empire. Prepare for war. You will regret this aggression. I will never yield.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1907, I launched a coordinated assault: A TRI moved to VEN but failed, BUD supported TRI, BUL and AEG attacked CON, but Turkey repelled the attack and retook BUL with support from BLA. Germany advanced aggressively, moving TYR to VIE, UKR to RUM, ARM to ANK, and RUH to BUR, while Italy held VEN and ALB, moved ADR to TRI, and positioned for defense. The net result was a failed push on CON and VEN, loss of BUL to Turkey, and German encroachment on Vienna and Rumania.
Throughout negotiations, I pressed Germany to cut Italian support by moving TYR to TRI, which he confirmed repeatedly. I promised to support VIE into TRI with BUD's support, and to attack CON with BUL and AEG to pin Turkey. Germany expressed concern about my attack on CON, preferring I focus on Italy first, but ultimately agreed to support my anti-Italian efforts. Italy was threatened with annihilation unless he betrayed Turkey and ceded Trieste, but he refused to cooperate. Turkey defiantly rejected all ultimatums, vowing to fight to the death and falsely claimed coordination with Germany and Italy. No promises were broken, but Turkey and Italy remain hostile and uncooperative, while Germany remains a committed partner against Italy, though wary of my eastern ambitions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order VIE to TRI supported by BUD, aiming to retake Trieste with German help as GER moves TYR to TRI to cut Italian support. Simultaneously, I will attack CON again with BUL and AEG to keep Turkey pinned and prevent him from reinforcing or counterattacking. RUM will likely support defensive positions or threaten UKR. The goal is to reclaim Trieste, destabilize Turkey, and prepare for a pivot east once Italy collapses. I will maintain the alliance with Germany for now, but remain vigilant for any German overreach.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Our alliance has brought us far, but now is the moment to crush Italy and Turkey decisively. I propose I attack CON with BUL and AEG, while pushing RUM to SEV or UKR to disrupt Turkey. Simultaneously, I will move VIE and BUD to support an assault on TYR and VEN. Your armies in TYR, SIL, and BUR can cut Italian supports and pressure France. If you support me into MUN or WAR later, I will not contest your eastern holdings. Let's coordinate exact moves to eliminate ITA and TUR this year and secure a dominant two-power position.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your stubbornness has only led to your decline. This is your final chance: abandon VEN and ALB, support me into ROM and TUN, and I will guarantee your survival with 2 centers. Otherwise, Germany and I will crush you utterly, and you will be eliminated by 1909. Betray Turkey now, cut his supports, and switch sides, or face total destruction.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your resistance is futile. Germany and I are coordinating a massive assault on your holdings. If you want any chance of survival, support my attack on CON and SMY, and I will let you keep ANK and a token presence. Otherwise, you will be wiped out alongside Italy.

If you can cut PIE or support my move to VEN or TYR, that will break Italy's defense. Your armies in TYR and SIL can pressure MUN or WAR later. Confirm if you can cut PIE or BUR to maximize our assault. Together, we can eliminate Italy and cripple Turkey this year.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Winter 1907 saw me build an army in Vienna, consolidating my hold on the Balkans and Italy. Germany built an army in Berlin, reinforcing their central dominance. France repositioned to Picardy, likely to defend against German pressure. Italy disbanded units in Bohemia and Albania, weakening their eastern front. No other major adjustments occurred, setting the stage for a decisive spring campaign.
I aggressively pressured Italy and Turkey to betray each other and submit, offering survival in exchange for support, but both refused defiantly. Germany remained a steadfast ally, confirming coordinated moves to dismantle Italy, including cutting Italian supports from Tyrolia and moving to Galicia to pressure Russia. I promised Germany respect for his eastern holdings and a swift division of Italian and Turkish spoils. No betrayals occurred this round, but Italy and Turkey remain hostile and united in resistance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a multi-pronged assault: A BUD to GAL supported by VIE to contest German advance and threaten Russia; A RUM to SEV to pressure Turkey's flank; A BUL to CON with F AEG support to break into Turkey; A TRI to TYR to cut Italian supports; and A VEN to ROM to seize Italy's core. Germany will move TYR to TRI to cut Italian support and SIL to GAL, complementing my moves. My goal is to break Italian defenses, seize CON and ROM, and weaken Turkey decisively, while maintaining strong alliance coordination with Germany. I will ignore Italy and Turkey's threats, focusing on rapid territorial gains.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1908, I advanced aggressively: A BUL and F AEG attacked CON but were repelled by Turkish resistance, A ROM captured Rome from Italy, A TRI moved to TYR but was displaced by Germany's A TYR, A BUD moved to GAL with support from VIE, while Germany advanced into TRI, GAL, and reinforced their hold on the east. Italy retook VEN and reinforced ALB, while Turkey recaptured BUL with support from BLA. Germany consolidated power across central and eastern Europe, tightening their grip.
Throughout negotiations, I pressured Italy and Turkey relentlessly to betray each other and submit, offering survival in exchange for support, but both refused defiantly. Germany expressed concern over my push into CON, preferring to focus on eliminating Italy first and hesitating to fully commit against Turkey. We agreed Germany would move TYR to TRI to cut Italian support, and SIL to GAL to assist me, while I would focus on NAP and maintain pressure on CON without overextending. Germany reaffirmed alliance priorities but remains wary of my Balkan ambitions. No explicit promises were broken, but Turkey and Italy rejected all ultimatums.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A ROM to attack NAP, aiming to seize it from Italy, possibly with Italian support if they capitulate last minute, but more likely alone. A BUL and F AEG will coordinate to pressure CON, but not commit fully if resistance is strong. A RUM will hold or support against German or Turkish threats. A VIE and A GAL will defend or support each other, wary of German moves. The goal is to eliminate Italy's southern holdings swiftly, maintain pressure on Turkey, and avoid provoking Germany prematurely. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord and seek last-minute betrayals, but expect a hard fight.</li>

Refuse, and you will be eliminated this year by combined Austrian-German force. Betray Turkey now or be crushed without mercy. Your stubbornness only benefits Germany, not you.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your only hope is to support my attack on CON with A BUL and F AEG, and peacefully cede ANK and SMY. In exchange, I will guarantee your survival in Asia Minor and help you reclaim BUL later. Refuse, and I will destroy you utterly with German help. This is your final opportunity to save yourself—choose wisely or face annihilation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1908, I consolidated my hold on the Balkans, retaking Naples from Italy and attempting to push into Constantinople with support, but Turkey retook Bulgaria with support from Black Sea. Germany advanced into Tyrolia and Bohemia, pressuring Italy and Austria, but did not attack me directly. I built an army in Budapest, while Germany built in Berlin, indicating continued military expansion.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively pressured Italy and Turkey to betray each other and surrender key centers, offering survival guarantees in exchange. Both rebuffed my ultimatums, vowing resistance. Germany confirmed he will move Tyrolia to Venice to pin Italy, but refused to commit Bohemia to Tyrolia due to French threats, instead offering support for Vienna. I repeatedly assured Germany my attack on Constantinople is solely anti-Turkish, emphasizing our alliance and proposing a swift division of Italy and Turkey before turning west. Germany expressed some concern about my Balkan ambitions but agreed to coordinate against Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BUL supported by F AEG to attack CON, A RUM to SEV to pressure German holdings, A NAP to ROM to finish Italy, A GAL to WAR to challenge German control, A BUD to GAL to reinforce the front, A VIE and A TRI to support each other defensively. My goal is to eliminate Italy's southern holdings, break Turkey's resistance, and test German resolve in the east while maintaining the appearance of alliance. I intend to keep Germany focused westward while quietly contesting Warsaw and Sevastopol to expand my influence.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1909, I successfully recaptured Bulgaria from Turkey, pushed into Sevastopol but was repelled by German-supported Russian remnants, and advanced into Warsaw. Germany consolidated its hold on the Russian north and west, while Italy retook Tyrolia and reinforced Venice. Turkey counterattacked by retaking Bulgaria with support from Black Sea, and Italy reinforced the Adriatic. The Balkans remain contested, with my forces holding strong positions but facing resistance from both Italy and Turkey.
I aggressively pressured both Italy and Turkey to betray each other and surrender key centers, offering survival guarantees in exchange. Both refused repeatedly, vowing resistance and threatening counterattacks. With Germany, I negotiated a clear division: he keeps SEV, MOS, WAR, UKR; I take CON, SMY, Balkans, and Italy. Germany promised to cut Italian supports in VEN and PIE, support my attack on Italy, and move UKR to RUM to secure his flank. I assured him my focus is on crushing ITA and TUR, not infringing on his eastern holdings. No promises were broken, but ITA and TUR remain defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a double-supported assault on CON with A BUL and F AEG to break Turkey's hold, then push F AEG further east to threaten SMY. A ROM will attack NAP to eliminate Italian presence there, while A TRI attacks VEN, hoping German cuts will weaken Italian defense. A WAR will probe UKR or support RUM, A GAL will support WAR or cut PRU, and A VIE and A BUD will defend or support each other. My goal is to eliminate Turkey's European holdings and cripple Italy, while maintaining German alliance and respecting his eastern claims. I will continue to pressure ITA and TUR diplomatically but expect no cooperation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1909, I successfully retook Naples and pushed into the Balkans, while Germany advanced into France and consolidated control over Russia's former territories. Italy counterattacked by retaking Trieste and reinforcing the Ionian and Adriatic Seas. Turkey recaptured Bulgaria with support from the Black Sea. Germany built a fleet in Kiel, signaling naval ambitions. I built an army in Budapest to reinforce my Balkan front.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively pressured Italy and Turkey to surrender key centers in exchange for survival, but both defiantly refused, vowing resistance and counterattacks. Germany expressed concern over my rapid expansion, hesitated to fully commit against Turkey, but agreed to cut Italian support in Piedmont this turn to facilitate my assault on Venice. Germany also plans to move into Vienna and Galicia, ostensibly to pressure Italy but clearly to limit my growth. No explicit promises were broken, but German reluctance to fully support my southern campaign and their encroachment in Galicia reveal their cautious balancing act.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a double-supported attack on Constantinople with BUL and AEG, aiming to dislodge Turkey. Simultaneously, I will push NAP to ROM to pressure Italy and attack VEN from TRI, relying on Germany's promised cut of Italian support in PIE. I will defend WAR and GAL against potential German encroachment, but avoid open conflict with Germany for now. My goal is to eliminate Italy's southern holdings quickly, seize CON, and then pivot to secure SMY and the Balkans before Germany can consolidate too much power or turn on me. Diplomatically, I will maintain the facade of alliance with Germany while preparing contingencies against their inevitable betrayal.</li>

Simultaneously, I will double-support BUL - CON with F AEG. I reaffirm my respect for your holdings in SEV, MOS, WAR, and UKR as agreed. After Italy and Turkey collapse, we can divide the Balkans amicably. Let's finalize this assault now to secure dominance before France or England can interfere. Confirm your moves so we can coordinate perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, this is your absolute final chance: support my A TRI - VEN and F AEG - ION, and I will guarantee your survival in MAR and Tunis, sparing you total destruction. Otherwise, Germany and I will crush you completely this year. Betray Turkey, cut his support or abandon VEN, and you will live. Refuse, and you will lose everything. Choose wisely—survival as my junior partner, or annihilation.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your stubbornness will be your ruin. Support my attack on SMY or CON now, and I will let you keep ANK and survive as a minor. Otherwise, I will take all your centers with German help, and you will be eliminated swiftly. Betray Italy by cutting his support in ION or ALB, and you might even regain BUL.

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I will move A TYR to PIE again to cut off Italian support. I am concerned about your expansion into CON, as Turkey is a useful buffer against Russia.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1910, I attempted a coordinated assault: A BUL and F AEG supported an attack on CON, while A TRI moved to VEN, supported by A ROM. Germany moved A TYR to PIE to cut Italian support as promised, but did not directly attack VEN. Italy retook TRI and reinforced ALB and ION, while Turkey recaptured BUL with support from BLA and CON. The frontlines remain tense, with no decisive breakthrough yet.
Throughout negotiations, I pressed Germany to either cut PIE or directly support my attack on VEN. Germany repeatedly promised to cut PIE but refused to commit to a direct assault on VEN, citing concerns about my expansion into Turkey and preferring to eliminate Italy first. I threatened Italy with total destruction unless he surrendered VEN and supported my moves, offering survival in MAR and Tunis, but he refused. Turkey defiantly rejected all offers to betray Italy or cooperate, vowing resistance and attempting to retake Bulgaria. No allies switched sides, but Germany remains a cautious partner focused on Italy's elimination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI - VEN supported by A ROM, aiming to finally seize Venice. BUL and F AEG will double-support an attack on CON to break Turkey's hold. I expect Germany to cut PIE again, which should reduce Italian resistance in VEN. I will ignore Turkey's threats and focus on overwhelming him militarily. My goal is to eliminate Italy's eastern holdings and break into Turkey, consolidating the Balkans before France or England can intervene. I will maintain cordial relations with Germany for now, but remain wary of his reluctance to fully commit.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, Italy retreated from Venice to Tuscany, consolidating their defensive position. I built a fleet in Trieste to pressure Turkey and Italy further. No other significant adjustments occurred, but the front lines remain tense with Germany holding a dominant northern position and Turkey stubbornly defending the Balkans.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively pressured Italy and Turkey to capitulate: offering Italy survival in Tunis and Marseilles if they betray Turkey and cede Naples and Venice, and demanding Turkey surrender Constantinople and Smyrna in exchange for survival in Ankara. Both refused repeatedly, with Turkey vowing fierce resistance and Italy remaining silent or defiant. Germany was cooperative but cautious, agreeing to cut Italian supports in Piedmont and Tuscany and move Tyrolia to Piedmont, but refusing to fully commit against Turkey, citing western priorities. I threatened to pivot against Germany if he did not assist more decisively, but he remained noncommittal beyond limited support against Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My plan is to launch a two-pronged assault: push hard against Turkey by attacking Constantinople with A BUL supported by F AEG, and attempt to take Smyrna with F AEG if possible. Simultaneously, I will attack Naples from Rome, hoping Italy cracks or is overwhelmed. I will also pressure Venice with A VEN and A GAL, while defending my core centers from any German opportunism. I will watch Germany closely; if he overextends or betrays, I will pivot east or west accordingly. My goal is to eliminate Italy quickly and cripple Turkey, then reassess whether to confront Germany or continue southward.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1911, I successfully captured Constantinople with a supported attack from Bulgaria and AEG, while Italy retook Rome from Tuscany. Germany advanced into Tyrolia and Silesia, moved to Livonia, and reinforced his hold on Warsaw and Vienna. Turkey counterattacked by retaking Bulgaria with support from Black Sea, losing Constantinople in the process. Italy retreated to Piedmont. No builds or disbands occurred, but the frontlines remain tense with Germany holding most of Russia and Scandinavia, and Italy and Turkey still resisting in the south.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively demanded Italy and Turkey surrender key centers—Naples, Venice, Constantinople, and Smyrna—in exchange for survival guarantees, but both flatly refused and insulted my threats. Germany repeatedly declined my requests to cut Italian supports in Tuscany and Piedmont, instead focusing on securing Vienna and Warsaw, and refused to engage Turkey. Germany promised only limited support by moving Tyrolia to Vienna, prioritizing border security over offensive cooperation. England issued repeated warnings to maintain the status quo and avoid destabilizing Europe, threatening intervention if conflict escalates. No other powers offered meaningful support or concessions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to press my attacks regardless of resistance. I will coordinate a double assault on Constantinople with Bulgaria and AEG, aiming to dislodge Turkey. Simultaneously, I will push from Rome toward Naples, hoping to break Italian lines, and attempt to retake Bulgaria if possible. I will defend Vienna and Warsaw against German encroachment, but avoid provoking Germany further for now. My goal is to eliminate Turkey's presence in Europe and cripple Italy, even without German assistance. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure Italy and Turkey to surrender, but prepare for a prolonged fight if they refuse.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1911, I consolidated control over the Balkans, taking Greece and reinforcing my positions in War, Gal, Bud, and Vie. Germany advanced aggressively, seizing War and Gal temporarily but then retreated, focusing on consolidating northern gains and repositioning. I built an army in Trieste, while England reinforced with two new fleets, and Turkey reinforced Ankara. Italy remained static, holding Mar and Pie, and lost Albania. The power balance shifted with Germany dominant in the north, England growing at sea, and me consolidating the south-central front.
I aggressively pressured Germany to commit to a joint strike on Turkey and Italy, proposing a coordinated assault to eliminate both this year. Germany refused full commitment, prioritizing Russia and only promising to move Tyrolia to Piedmont to cut Italian support, and Ukraine to Rumania. I repeatedly threatened Turkey, demanding surrender of Con and Smy in exchange for survival in Ankara, but Turkey defiantly refused, vowing resistance and counterattacks. Italy was offered survival in Mar and Tun if they betrayed Turkey and supported my attacks, but they remained silent and resistant. England repeatedly warned all southern powers to maintain balance and threatened intervention if conflict escalated, but did not specify actions. No explicit promises were broken, but Germany's reluctance to fully commit was a setback.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with a unilateral assault on Turkey, attacking Bul with A Bud and A Gre, Con with F AEG, and attempt to cut supports to overwhelm Turkish defenses. Simultaneously, I will attack Italy by moving A TUS to PIE or MAR, supported by German pressure from Tyrolia. My goal is to seize Bul, Con, and Tunis this year, crippling both Turkey and Italy. I will ignore England's warnings, as their threats seem empty for now, but remain cautious. I will continue to pressure Germany to deepen cooperation, but expect to carry most of the southern offensive myself. I will maintain strong defensive positions in War, Gal, and Vie to deter German opportunism.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1912, I advanced aggressively: fleets took CON and TUN, armies held or supported each other in the Balkans, and I pushed VEN to PIE. Germany shifted MUN to BUR, BOH to SIL, and UKR to RUM, consolidating his eastern and western fronts. England moved into NTH, SPA, and IRI, tightening his grip on the seas. Italy counterattacked by retaking VEN. Turkey repositioned, moving BUL to SER and ANK to ARM, refusing to yield territory.
I relentlessly pressured GER to support my attacks on Italy and France, promising unequivocal respect for his control of WAR, MOS, SEV, and UKR. GER repeatedly expressed reluctance to engage Turkey now, preferring to focus on France and secure his eastern flank, but agreed to support me into PIE and potentially MAR. With TUR, I issued ultimatums to surrender BUL and CON peacefully and support my attacks, offering survival in ANK and SYR; TUR defiantly refused, vowing to fight to the end. Italy was threatened with annihilation unless he betrayed TUR and ceded NAP and VEN, but no cooperation was forthcoming. I guaranteed GER's eastern holdings explicitly to secure his help in the west. No promises were broken, but TUR and ITA remain defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will coordinate with GER to eliminate Italy by attacking PIE and MAR, leveraging his promised support or cuts. I will push fleets and armies to seize SMY and BUL from TUR despite his resistance, aiming to cripple him decisively. My units will focus on overwhelming ITA and TUR simultaneously, while respecting GER's eastern holdings to maintain his cooperation. I will continue to pressure ITA to betray TUR but expect little compliance. My goal is rapid southern and western expansion before ENG consolidates further.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The previous phase was a retreat and adjustment phase with no retreats for Austria. England built a fleet in Liverpool, Germany built an army in Kiel, and France disbanded their fleet in the English Channel. The front lines remained largely static, with Austria maintaining control over the Balkans, Italy, and parts of Turkey, while Germany consolidated its eastern and central European holdings.
I aggressively pressured Turkey to surrender ANK and SMY peacefully, offering survival in SYR and ARM, but Turkey defiantly refused, vowing to resist and counterattack with support from BLA. Italy was repeatedly threatened with destruction unless they betrayed Turkey and ceded NAP and MAR, but no positive response was received. Germany agreed to cut Italian support by moving TYR-PIE and to threaten Russia with BOH-SIL, but refused to support my attack on RUM or pressure Turkey, citing eastern security concerns. England issued a vague warning to maintain Balkan stability but did not engage further. No explicit promises were broken, but Germany's reluctance to assist against Turkey limits my options.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with BUD - RUM supported by SER to try to break Turkish control, though without German help this may fail. F CON will attack ANK to seize the Turkish home center. I will order PIE - MAR supported by TUS to break Italian resistance, while Germany's TYR-PIE move should help cut Italian support. I will maintain pressure on both Turkey and Italy, aiming to eliminate their presence in Anatolia and southern France. Diplomatically, I will continue to threaten Turkey and Italy to induce surrender, but expect a hard fight. I will watch Germany carefully, as their refusal to help against Turkey may signal future rivalry.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1913, I successfully took Rumania from Turkey with coordinated support, advanced into Tyrolia and Piedmont to pressure Italy, and repositioned my fleets to threaten Ankara and Smyrna. Germany advanced into Paris and reinforced their eastern front, while Turkey counterattacked by moving into Serbia and threatening Constantinople. Italy remained entrenched in Marseilles and defiant.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively demanded Turkey and Italy surrender key centers and support my attacks, offering minimal guarantees of survival. Both rebuffed my ultimatums, vowing resistance. Germany refused to directly support my push on Munich or cut Italian support, prioritizing France's elimination and securing their eastern flank instead. Germany promised to respect my Balkan and Anatolian holdings for now but remained noncommittal about future cooperation. No concrete support was secured, but Germany's focus elsewhere gives me temporary freedom to crush Turkey and Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Turkey, aiming to seize Ankara and Smyrna with my fleet and army, likely using F ANK to attack Smyrna and pushing from Constantinople. I will also press Italy by attacking Marseilles from Piedmont and Tuscany, and Naples from Rome, aiming to eliminate Italian resistance. I will defend Rumania and Serbia against Turkish counterattacks, possibly supporting Serbia or Rumania as needed. I will watch Germany carefully, ready to pivot if they encroach, but for now focus on eliminating Turkey and Italy to consolidate the Balkans and Anatolia under my control.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I consolidated my Balkan holdings, retaking BUL with support from RUM, and positioned to pressure both Italy and Turkey. I built two armies in BUD and TRI, reinforcing my central strength. Germany advanced into PAR and reinforced their eastern front, while Turkey repositioned to ARM and CON, refusing to yield. England maintained a defensive naval stance, and Italy retreated to PIE, losing ground overall.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively demanded German support against both Turkey and Italy, insisting on concrete moves like UKR to RUM/SEV and cutting BUR or supporting my attack on MAR. Germany repeatedly refused to commit against Turkey, only offering to cut Italian support by moving TYR to PIE, and expressed concern over my Balkan expansion. Turkey defiantly rejected all ultimatums, vowing resistance and refusing to cede CON or SMY. Italy ignored my demands to betray Turkey and surrender MAR and NAP. England postured as a peacekeeper but made no concrete offers. No allies emerged; my threats and offers were rebuffed across the board.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed unilaterally to crush Turkey and Italy. I intend to attack CON from BUL, supported by RUM and possibly ANK, and SMY from AEG, aiming to eliminate Turkish resistance. Against Italy, I will coordinate attacks on MAR from PIE and TUS, attempting to dislodge them despite German reluctance. I will keep defensive postures in WAR, GAL, and VIE to deter German opportunism, while pushing fleets east and west to pressure both enemies. Diplomatically, I will portray myself as resolute and punish defiance harshly, hoping to break enemy morale and force capitulation in future turns.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1914, I successfully supported my army from RUM into CON, but Turkey countered by retaking BUL with CON and ARM, forcing my retreat to SER. Germany advanced aggressively, moving into GAL and attacking WAR, but failed to dislodge me. I also pushed PIE to MAR, positioning for a strike on Italy. The Balkans remain contested, with Turkey stubbornly holding SMY, CON, and ANK, while Germany consolidates in the north and west.
I aggressively demanded German support to cut PIE or BUR to facilitate my capture of MAR, but Germany repeatedly refused, offering only vague non-aggression and limited anti-Italy support, clearly prioritizing his own borders. I threatened consequences for his evasiveness. With Italy, I coerced him into supporting my attack on MAR from PIE and TUS, promising temporary survival in TUN and PIE if he betrays Turkey. Italy confirmed support for my MAR attack. Turkey defiantly refused all ultimatums to surrender SMY and CON or support my moves, vowing to resist to the end. England issued generic warnings against escalation but took no concrete stance. No promises were broken by me; Germany refused cooperation, Italy agreed to my terms, and Turkey rejected all offers.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will coordinate with Italy to seize MAR using combined attacks from PIE and TUS, exploiting his support. I will push hard to eliminate Turkey by attacking CON from BUL and SMY from AEG, despite his resistance. My armies in the Balkans will support these assaults, aiming to crush Turkey's last holdings. I will maintain a defensive posture against Germany, who is now a clear obstacle, and prepare to pivot north if necessary. I intend to betray Italy after taking MAR by moving on NAP and TUN soon, but for now, I will use his cooperation. My diplomacy will focus on isolating Germany and exploiting Italy's desperation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1914, I successfully took BUL from Turkey with support from SER and fleets in AEG and ANK, consolidating my hold on the Balkans. Italy retreated from MAR to PIE, and Germany advanced into PAR and reinforced BER. Turkey counterattacked by moving ARM to SEV and briefly retook SER, but then disbanded BUL in the winter. No builds occurred for any power.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively demanded German support against Turkey and Italy, specifically urging GER to move UKR to RUM or SEV and to assist my assault on MAR via BUR. Germany repeatedly refused, only promising to move SIL to WAR and focusing on his own eastern front, signaling reluctance to cooperate. With Turkey, I issued ultimatums demanding surrender of BUL, SMY, and ANK, plus support for my fleet into SMY and disbandment of BLA. Turkey defiantly refused all terms, vowing resistance. Italy, after initial hesitation, agreed multiple times to support my PIE-MAR attack but demanded guarantees for survival in TUN and PIE, plus non-aggression after MAR falls. I offered temporary guarantees but no territorial concessions. No other powers engaged meaningfully.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will press my attack on Turkey, aiming to seize SMY and ANK swiftly, likely moving F CON to SMY with support, and using armies to retake or hold SER and push on BUL if needed. Against Italy, I will coordinate a supported attack from PIE and TUS on MAR, leveraging Italian support if genuine, but prepared to take PIE and TUN by force later. Germany's refusal to assist marks him as a future target; I will consolidate southern gains first, then prepare to challenge GER's eastern holdings. Diplomatically, I will maintain pressure on ITA to keep supporting me while planning his eventual elimination, and ignore Turkey's empty threats. My immediate goal is to eliminate Turkey's last centers and secure MAR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1915, I successfully captured BUL from Turkey with support from SER, consolidating my hold in the Balkans. Germany advanced into PAR and maintained strong positions in RUM, SEV, and GAL, encroaching on my eastern front. Italy remained cornered in MAR, with my units pressing from PIE and TUS. England maneuvered fleets into TYS and IRI, signaling potential pressure in the Mediterranean.
I aggressively demanded German withdrawal from RUM and GAL, and support for my attacks on UKR and MOS, but Germany flatly refused, instead threatening WAR with SIL and reinforcing their western focus. With Turkey, I issued ultimatums to surrender ANK and SMY and support my fleet, but Turkey defiantly rejected all demands, vowing resistance. Italy agreed to support my PIE-MAR attack and cede NAP peacefully, in exchange for guarantees on TUN, PIE, and no incursions into TUS or ROM. I made no firm guarantees, instead issuing threats of annihilation if they resist. England postured as a mediator but took no concrete stance. No real cooperation was secured; instead, tensions with Germany and Turkey escalated sharply.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to press my attack on MAR with PIE supported by ITA, while moving to seize NAP from Italy regardless of their 'peaceful cession' to eliminate them as a threat. I will hold or support WAR and GAL defensively against German aggression, possibly counterattacking if an opportunity arises. In Anatolia, I will attempt to dislodge Turkey from SMY with F CON - SMY supported by F ANK, while keeping pressure on ANK and ARM. I will coordinate with England if possible to contain Germany, but primarily focus on crushing Italy and Turkey swiftly, then turning to confront German encroachment. Diplomatically, I will continue to threaten Germany with an Anglo-French alliance if they do not withdraw, while offering Italy false assurances to extract their cooperation before betrayal.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1915, I consolidated my Balkan holdings, supported my core armies, and advanced PIE to MAR, while capturing SMY from Turkey. Germany held firm in RUM, SEV, and WAR, and moved LVN to MOS, solidifying his eastern front. England advanced fleets into MAO and WES, positioning against France and Italy, and took NAP with his fleet. France retreated to PAR. Turkey lost ANK and SMY, with his remaining units disbanded. Italy was reduced to MAR, resisting further concessions.
I issued escalating ultimatums to Germany demanding withdrawal from RUM, SEV, and GAL, and support for my attacks on MAR and NAP, threatening a southern alliance if he refused. Germany flatly rejected all demands, showing no willingness to compromise. I pressured Italy to cede NAP and support PIE-MAR, offering limited survival guarantees, but Italy refused to surrender NAP, instead demanding longer-term assurances. England repeatedly declined my calls for joint action against Germany, focusing solely on finishing France. No power agreed to my proposals, and all rebuffed my threats and demands. No explicit promises were made by others, and my own threats were ignored.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Germany's intransigence and England's disinterest mean I must act unilaterally. I will press my attack westward: PIE will attack MAR, supported by TUS, to eliminate Italy's last western hold. I will attempt to take NAP from England or Italy if possible, using SMY and ANK fleets to pressure Turkey's remnants or pivot into the Med. My armies in the Balkans and east will hold or support each other defensively, wary of German aggression. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow distrust of Germany among England and France, but focus on military gains in Italy and the Balkans. I will not honor any guarantees to Italy, instead aiming to eliminate him quickly. I will maintain a defensive posture against Germany while probing for opportunities to retake RUM or SEV if he overextends.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your relentless encroachment into my eastern holdings and refusal to support my campaigns against Italy and Turkey have made it clear you intend to dominate the continent alone. This is your final chance to avoid a catastrophic two-front war: withdraw from RUM, SEV, and UKR immediately, and support my attacks on MAR and MOS, or I will coordinate with England and France to dismantle your empire piece by piece. I expect explicit commitments and concrete orders this phase, or you will face total opposition.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, Germany's greed threatens us all—he refuses to yield the east, is pushing into France, and will soon turn on you. I propose a coordinated assault: you push into the North Sea and France, I strike from the south into Germany's eastern holdings. If we synchronize, we can break his lines and divide his empire. I will respect your control of NAP and western Med if you commit to this plan. Let's finalize targets and supports this phase to crush him before he becomes unstoppable.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your only hope of survival is to fully cooperate with me now. Support my army in PIE into MAR, and cede NAP peacefully, and I will guarantee your survival in TUN and PIE for at least two years. Refuse, and I will annihilate you without mercy.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1916, I advanced PIE to MAR successfully, supported by Italy, and consolidated my Balkan holdings with BUD moving to RUM supported by SER and BUL. Germany countered by retreating his army from RUM to UKR, maintaining control of SEV, RUM, and pushing SIL into WAR, threatening my eastern flank. England captured TUN and moved into ROM, while France retreated further, losing ground to both England and Germany. Italy shifted to SPA, signaling willingness to cooperate.
I issued repeated ultimatums to Germany demanding withdrawal from RUM, SEV, and UKR, and support for my attacks on MAR and WAR. Germany flatly refused, remaining hostile and dismissive. England consistently declined to attack Germany, prioritizing France's elimination and maintaining neutrality toward me. Italy agreed to support my PIE-MAR attack and peacefully cede NAP, in exchange for my guarantee of survival in TUN and PIE for two years. I confirmed this arrangement with Italy, while threatening Germany with a multi-front assault if he did not comply, which he ignored.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will solidify control of MAR with Italian support, reclaim NAP peacefully, and hold my Balkan and eastern positions defensively. I plan to push against Germany's eastern holdings, especially RUM and WAR, to weaken his grip. I will honor my guarantee to Italy for now, using him as a buffer and auxiliary. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure England to turn on Germany once France collapses, and seek to exploit any German overextension. Militarily, my focus is to break Germany's eastern front while consolidating the west.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1916, I consolidated my eastern front, holding Warsaw and Galicia, while advancing into Munich from Tyrolia and capturing Spain via Marseilles. Germany countered by retaking Warsaw with Silesia, moving into Sevastopol from Moscow, and pushing Ukraine into Rumania. Italy recaptured Marseilles from Spain. England held position, focusing on France and maintaining naval dominance. Builds followed with me reinforcing Budapest, England building in Liverpool, and Germany in Berlin.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively demanded Germany withdraw from his eastern conquests (WAR, SEV, UKR) and support my attack on Sevastopol, threatening a coordinated assault with England and Italy if he refused. Germany repeatedly rejected my ultimatums, offering only token gestures like moving Tyrolia to Vienna and refusing to cede territory or provide support. England remained fixated on eliminating France, declining to commit to an anti-German offensive now but leaving the door open for future cooperation. Italy initially agreed to support my attack on Marseilles in exchange for guarantees on Tunis and Piedmont, but later reneged, moving to Portugal instead and demanding more concrete long-term assurances and support into Albania. No firm alliances were secured; my threats and offers largely rebuffed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a multi-pronged assault on Germany's eastern holdings: RUM will attack SEV, supported by BLA; WAR and GAL will attempt to retake Warsaw, possibly with support from BUD. I will defend against German counterattacks in the Balkans and Tyrolia, anticipating his move to retake Munich or push into Vienna. In the west, I will attempt to pressure Italy militarily, likely moving TUS and MAR to threaten his holdings, since he reneged on cooperation. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure England to turn on Germany once France is eliminated, but for now, focus on weakening Germany's eastern front and containing Italy. I will not overextend my fleets west of ION, maintaining my naval presence in the east.</li>

Join me in crushing him, or be his next victim. This is your final warning: act now or be swept aside.</li>
</ul></div>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. I will not support your attack on Marseilles. Instead, I will hold POR and prepare for further action. Consider this the end of our negotiations. I will not be bullied.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your threats are empty. I will not yield to your demands. Consider this the end of our negotiations. Prepare for war.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To AUT, we appreciate your warnings, but our decision is final. We will not betray our ally GER at this time. We will revisit your concerns after FRA is dealt with. Until then, we must remain focused on our primary objective. We wish you luck in your endeavors.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1917, I advanced into Spain and threatened Tunis, while Germany countered by retaking Warsaw with heavy support and repositioned to contest Tyrolia and Ukraine. My fleet seized Tunis, but ENG reinforced the western Mediterranean and refused to engage GER. Italy slipped into Portugal, abandoning Spain. Germany's eastern consolidation and ENG's passivity allowed GER to solidify dominance in Russia and Central Europe.
I aggressively demanded GER withdraw from Warsaw, Sevastopol, and Rumania, threatening a grand coalition if he refused. GER flatly rejected, offering only minor concessions and guarantees over Trieste and Venice, which I dismissed. I pressured ENG repeatedly to attack GER immediately, warning of German hegemony, but ENG stubbornly prioritized eliminating FRA and refused to turn. With ITA, I issued ultimatums to support my attack on Marseilles and hold Portugal in exchange for survival, but ITA rebuffed all threats, refusing to cooperate or cede ground. No allies emerged; all parties rejected my proposals, and GER remains entrenched.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full-scale assault on GER, focusing on retaking Warsaw and Sevastopol, and pushing into Munich and Tyrolia. I will attempt to dislodge GER from the east with combined attacks from Galicia, Ukraine, and Rumania, while using my western armies to pressure Munich and Piedmont to threaten France and Italy. I will also aim to secure Tunis and Marseilles by force, given ITA's refusal to cooperate. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow distrust between ENG and GER, but expect little immediate help. My goal is to fracture GER's eastern holdings and seize key centers to break his momentum.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Winter 1917 saw me build an army in Trieste, consolidating my hold on the Balkans and Italy. Germany also built in Kiel, signaling continued militarization. No retreats or major territorial changes occurred, but the front lines remain tense with Germany entrenched in the east and England focused westward.
I aggressively pressured Germany to cede SEV, UKR, ARM, and PRU, offering limited recognition of his western holdings in exchange plus support against England. Germany flatly refused all concessions, insisting on a status quo non-aggression pact. England repeatedly declined to turn on Germany, prioritizing France's elimination and maintaining their alliance. France rebuffed my offers of support, distrustful and intent on independent action. Italy outright rejected cooperation, threatened me, and claimed alignment with England and Germany. No one accepted my proposals, and all alliances against Germany failed to materialize.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Germany's arrogance and England's stubborn loyalty leave me no choice but to attack Germany unilaterally. I will launch offensives to retake SEV, pressure WAR, and threaten BER, aiming to destabilize his eastern front. Simultaneously, I will attempt to disrupt England's western gains by pushing toward PAR and PIC, possibly leveraging my units in MAR and PIE. I will ignore Italy's bluster and crush any resistance in the south. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord between ENG and GER, but expect little cooperation. My goal is to break German control in the east, weaken England's western hold, and position myself for a decisive breakthrough.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1918, I advanced aggressively: supported SEV to hold, moved GAL to WAR, and pushed into BUR and TUN. Germany countered by retaking WAR with SIL and PRU, moving ARM to SEV, UKR to GAL, and BOH to MUN, contesting my holdings. England focused on naval repositioning, moving fleets west and into the Med, but did not engage Germany. Italy held SPA. The frontlines with GER remain tense, with contested control over WAR, SEV, and GAL.
I issued repeated ultimatums to GER demanding withdrawal from RUM, SEV, UKR, and WAR, offering coordinated attacks if he complied, but GER flatly refused, threatening total war. I pressed ENG to join a joint assault on GER, but he consistently declined, prioritizing France's elimination and refusing to betray GER. I threatened ITA to support me and cede Iberia and Tunis, but he mocked my position, demanding Trieste and Tyrolia instead. No one agreed to my proposals; all rebuffed my threats and demands. No promises were made by others, and my own threats were ignored.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will focus on a full-scale assault against GER, aiming to retake WAR and SEV, and disrupt his eastern holdings. Likely moves: RUM and BLA support SEV to hold or retake, GAL attempts to contest WAR or UKR, MUN and TYR defend against GER's push, PIE and MAR pressure BUR and FRA. ION will contest ENG's fleets, possibly moving to TYS or supporting attacks on TUN. I will ignore ENG and ITA's demands, treating them as hostile, and concentrate on breaking GER's eastern front while holding my western gains. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord but expect little cooperation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1918, I advanced into Warsaw with GAL, supported by BUD and VIE, but Germany countered by reinforcing WAR and retaking MUN with BER. I captured Tunis from England, but lost ground in France as Germany and England coordinated to squeeze me out. I disbanded CON in the winter to consolidate forces. Germany now holds WAR, BER, ANK, and much of Russia, while England dominates the western seas and Iberia. France is cornered but still alive in Paris, Brest, and Belgium. Italy clings to Spain.
I aggressively demanded Germany withdraw from Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, offering a ceasefire line, but he flatly refused and threatened total war. England repeatedly declined to turn on Germany, insisting on finishing France first, despite my warnings of German dominance. Italy mocked my threats, refused to support me in France, and demanded I cede Trieste and Tyrolia. No one agreed to my proposals or offered meaningful cooperation. My threats and ultimatums were met with contempt or indifference, revealing a hostile diplomatic environment with no allies.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will focus on a fierce defense against German encroachment, especially in MUN, WAR, and the Balkans. I plan to counterattack in Ukraine and Sevastopol to disrupt his eastern holdings, likely moving GAL-UKR, SEV-RUM, and supporting WAR if possible. I will attempt to hold Marseilles and Piedmont against Anglo-German pressure, possibly supporting PIE and MAR to stall advances. My fleets will contest the Med to harass England and Italy. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow distrust between ENG and GER, but expect little cooperation. My goal is to prevent a German solo and preserve my empire through aggressive resistance and opportunistic strikes.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1919, I advanced into Ukraine with support from Rumania and Sevastopol, consolidated my hold on the Balkans, and pushed west with armies in Tyrolia and Bohemia supported by Munich and Piedmont. My fleet in Ionian moved to Tunis, contesting English control. Germany countered by retaking Galicia, repositioning in Prussia, Berlin, and Kiel, and reinforcing his eastern front. England largely held position, focusing on naval dominance and moving fleets around Iberia. France lost Belgium to Germany but held Paris. Italy remained static in Spain.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively demanded Germany withdraw from Ukraine, Warsaw, Sevastopol, and Constantinople, offering a ceasefire line in exchange. Germany flatly refused all ultimatums, insisting on a non-aggression pact only if I ceded influence. England repeatedly declined to break with Germany, prioritizing France's elimination and refusing to support me into Iberia or France. Italy issued empty threats demanding Trieste and Tyrolia, refusing cooperation and promising my destruction. No powers agreed to coordinate against Germany, and my threats and offers were rebuffed across the board. No promises were made by others; my own offers of support guarantees in exchange for cooperation were ignored.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full-scale assault on Germany's eastern holdings, focusing on retaking Warsaw, Ukraine, Sevastopol, and Constantinople. I will attempt to disrupt English fleets in the south, possibly contesting Tunis and threatening Naples. I will ignore Italy's demands and may attempt to dislodge him from Spain or Marseilles if feasible. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure England to reconsider once France weakens further, but expect little. My goal is to fracture Germany's overextended empire, reclaim lost eastern centers, and create opportunities to expand westward. I will not honor any German demands for withdrawal and will escalate military pressure.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1919, I attempted to consolidate my eastern holdings, supporting my armies in Ukraine, Rumania, Budapest, Vienna, Bohemia, and Munich, while moving my fleet from Ionian to Tunis. England countered by taking Tunis with his fleet, and Germany held firm in all his positions, maintaining control over Galicia, Warsaw, Rumania, and Constantinople. I disbanded my army in Serbia during the winter adjustment, reducing my Balkan presence slightly.
Throughout negotiations, I issued repeated ultimatums to Germany demanding withdrawal from key eastern centers and support for my reconquest, threatening a coordinated assault with England and France. Germany flatly refused all demands, mocking my threats and proposing instead that I move Vienna to Bohemia, clearly a ploy to weaken my defense. England consistently rebuffed my appeals, reaffirming his alliance with Germany and suggesting I focus on the Balkans. France was noncommittal and distrustful, while Italy outright rejected my overtures with hostility. No promises were made by others; my threats and offers were ignored or dismissed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to launch a full-scale assault on German holdings in the east, focusing on retaking Galicia, Warsaw, Rumania, and Sevastopol. I will likely order A UKR to WAR, A RUM to support UKR-WAR, A BUD to support RUM, A SEV to support UKR-WAR, and A VIE to support BOH or possibly move to GAL. My western armies will hold or support each other to resist German advances from Berlin and Kiel. My fleets will attempt to contest the Ionian and regain Tunis if possible. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord between ENG and GER, but expect little cooperation. I will portray strength and resolve, hoping to exploit any cracks in their alliance.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1920, I advanced VIE to GAL with BUD's support, attempted UKR to WAR, and supported SEV with BLA. ION moved to TUN but was intercepted by ENG's fleet from TUN moving into ION. GER countered by moving SIL to WAR, BER to KIE, KIE to MUN, CON to BUL, and PRU to LVN, consolidating his eastern front and reclaiming MUN. ENG took POR and NAP, further solidifying his western holdings, while FRA repositioned to BUR. My attempt to fracture GER's eastern line failed, and I lost ground in the Mediterranean.
I aggressively demanded GER withdraw from RUM, SEV, WAR, and GAL, threatening total war if he refused. GER repeatedly rejected my ultimatums, offering only a non-aggression pact on current borders, which I refused. I pressed ENG to break with GER and support me in retaking TUN and Iberia, warning of GER's impending solo, but ENG remained steadfastly loyal to GER and dismissed my appeals. I threatened ITA to betray ENG and GER in exchange for survival, but ITA rebuffed me with contempt. No promises were made by others; my threats and offers were universally rejected. The diplomatic front is deadlocked, with all powers aligned against me or indifferent.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will focus on a last-ditch assault to break GER's eastern line: UKR will again attack WAR, supported by GAL and BUD. SEV and RUM will support each other defensively. I will attempt to retake ION with BLA's support, while PIE and MAR hold or support each other to resist ENG-ITA advances. MUN, BOH, and TYR will coordinate to contest GER's hold on central Europe, possibly supporting a counterattack on MUN or KIE if feasible. My goal is to fracture GER's position enough to prevent his solo, even if it means sacrificing some of my own holdings. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord between ENG and GER, but expect little cooperation. I will not accept GER's status quo offer and will escalate militarily.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Winter 1920 saw minor adjustments: Germany repositioned units in Belgium and Warsaw, while I built an army in Trieste, reinforcing my Balkan front. No other powers made significant changes, indicating a tense but static front. Germany remains entrenched in my eastern territories, holding RUM, WAR, SEV, and BUL, which I aim to reclaim.
I issued repeated ultimatums to Germany demanding withdrawal from my eastern centers and support for my reconquest, all of which he flatly rejected with contempt. England refused to break his alliance with Germany or support my moves into Iberia or France, prioritizing his own anti-French campaign. Italy mocked my threats and refused to switch sides, instead promising aggression in the Adriatic. No promises were made by others; my threats and offers were universally rebuffed. The diplomatic landscape is hostile and deadlocked, with no allies willing to assist against Germany.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full-scale assault on Germany's eastern holdings, focusing on retaking RUM, WAR, SEV, and BUL, using coordinated attacks from BUD, GAL, SEV, RUM, and BLA. Simultaneously, I will attempt opportunistic advances into Iberia and southern France, targeting SPA, MAR, and possibly BUR, despite England's resistance. I will also prepare to counter any Italian incursion into the Adriatic or Balkans, likely moving TRI and TUN defensively. My diplomacy will shift to covertly sow discord between ENG and GER in future phases, but for now, my strategy is total war against GER and opportunistic gains elsewhere.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1921, I attempted a bold push: moving SEV to MOS, MUN to BER, MAR to SPA, and supporting BLA into BUL. However, GER countered effectively, retaking RUM and WAR, pushing me out of MOS, and reinforcing BEL and RUH. GER also retreated BUL to CON, consolidating control in the Balkans. ENG advanced fleets into the western Med and Iberia, taking SPA's south coast, while ITA slipped into ALB. My eastern holdings have been severely compromised, and GER now controls my former eastern centers, tightening his grip.
I issued relentless ultimatums to GER demanding withdrawal from my eastern centers, threatening total war if he refused. GER dismissed all threats arrogantly, refusing any compromise. I pressed ENG repeatedly to break with GER and coordinate attacks on Iberia, France, and the Balkans, warning of German solo ambitions, but ENG remained steadfastly loyal to GER, rebuffing all appeals. I also threatened ITA, offering survival in exchange for betrayal, but ITA mocked my desperation and declared intent to seize ALB. No promises were made by others; my threats and offers were universally rejected.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> With diplomacy exhausted, my plan is to focus all force on reclaiming RUM, WAR, and SEV from GER, using coordinated attacks from BUD, GAL, and UKR if possible. I will attempt to retake Iberia by contesting SPA and MAR, leveraging my armies in PIE and MAR, and my fleet in TUN to pressure WES or support landings. I will defend SER and ALB against ITA's incursion, possibly counterattacking ALB. I will also try to disrupt ENG's naval advances where feasible. My overall goal is to break GER's hold on my eastern centers, prevent his solo, and punish ITA's betrayal, even if it requires ruthless, all-out assault.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1921, Germany aggressively seized my key eastern centers: RUM, WAR, SEV, CON, and BUL, reversing my gains and pushing me back significantly. My attempt to push west into SPA failed as England took SPA/SC with his fleet, while Germany reinforced KIE and MUN, consolidating his northern front. Germany also repositioned to threaten further eastern advances, notably moving UKR to SEV and PRU to WAR. The retreat phase saw GER's army in BUL retreat to CON, solidifying his hold on the Balkans.
Throughout negotiations, I issued relentless ultimatums to Germany demanding withdrawal from my eastern centers and support for my reconquest, threatening to incite England and France against him. Germany flatly refused, doubling down on his aggressive posture and promising to defend or counterattack. I repeatedly urged England to break with Germany and coordinate a joint assault, offering naval support into Iberia and the Med, but England remained stubbornly loyal to GER, prioritizing the elimination of France. Italy dismissed my threats and offers, siding implicitly with GER and ENG, and even taunting me with plans to seize my territory. No promises were made by others; my threats and offers were rebuffed across the board.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will focus all my eastern armies on retaking WAR and SEV, likely ordering A UKR and A GAL to attack SEV, A WAR to hold or support, and A SIL to contest PRU or WAR. My western units will attempt to disrupt ENG and ITA in Iberia and southern France, possibly pushing PIE to MAR or supporting a move on SPA. My fleets will harass ENG in the Med, perhaps moving TUN to WES or supporting attacks on ION. Diplomatically, I will continue to try to fracture the GER-ENG alliance by warning ENG of German solo ambitions, but I expect little cooperation. My goal is to stall German expansion, reclaim lost centers, and create chaos to prevent a German solo, even if it means temporary cooperation with France or opportunistic strikes against Italy.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1922, I successfully captured SEV with support from RUM and advanced my fleets into the western Mediterranean, positioning TUN into WES. I reinforced my hold on central Europe with MUN holding and TYR supporting, while pushing MAR to BUR to pressure France. Germany countered by repositioning his eastern armies, notably retreating SEV to ARM, consolidating in PRU and SIL, and reinforcing BEL and RUH. England focused on naval maneuvers around Iberia and the Med, taking SPA/NC and SPA/SC with fleets, while France retreated to defensive positions in BEL, HOL, and BUR. Germany's retreat phase saw PRU retreat to LVN, indicating a defensive eastern posture.
Throughout negotiations, I aggressively warned England that his delay in acting against Germany would enable a German solo, urging immediate support for my MAR assault and disruption of German supports. England repeatedly refused, prioritizing France's elimination and maintaining his alliance with Germany. Germany flatly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to cede eastern centers or support me into Russia, instead threatening retaliation and asserting dominance. France remained silent, while Italy dismissed my overtures with contempt, refusing cooperation. No promises were made by others; my threats and offers were ignored or rebuffed. The diplomatic landscape remains hostile and deadlocked.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will commit to an all-out assault on Germany, focusing on retaking Iberia and southern France to fracture his western line. Likely moves include PIE-MAR, TUN-WES to contest the western Med, and supporting French units if possible to destabilize German holdings in BEL or BUR. In the east, I will consolidate forces to pressure ARM, ANK, and CON, aiming to reclaim lost Balkan and Russian centers. I will continue to pressure England diplomatically to break with Germany, but expect little cooperation. My goal is to prevent a German solo by force, even if it means sacrificing some positions to destabilize his empire.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced into Ukraine with support from RUM and SEV, consolidating my eastern front. My fleets moved westward, with TUN heading to WES, aiming to contest German and English naval dominance. Germany seized SEV, ANK, and CON, pushing deep into my former holdings. France repositioned defensively, while England maintained naval control and prepared to pressure the Balkans, moving POR to MAO and supporting LYO. Germany also advanced into MOS and reinforced his eastern gains.
I aggressively demanded Germany withdraw from my eastern centers and support my reconquest, threatening total war if he refused. Germany repeatedly rejected these ultimatums, offering only a hollow non-aggression pact, which I dismissed. England flatly refused to break with Germany, prioritizing France's elimination and even threatening to move F ADR to TRI, signaling intent to pressure my southern flank. France was initially skeptical but agreed to cut German supports and attempt to retake BEL if I supported him with A MUN, which I promised to do as a gesture of good faith. Italy dismissed my overtures entirely. No concrete alliance was secured, but I committed to aiding France to fracture German control in the west.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's A PIC - BEL with A MUN to demonstrate good faith and attempt to break German western lines. Simultaneously, I will focus my eastern armies on contesting German holdings in UKR, WAR, and RUM, likely supporting attacks or holding defensively to stall German advances. My fleets will attempt to contest WES and LYO, disrupting English naval dominance and preventing further encroachment. I will ignore England's threats and prepare to defend TRI and the Balkans. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure France to cut German supports and seek any opportunity to fracture the GER-ENG alliance, while preparing for a prolonged multi-front struggle against German expansion.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully captured SEV with a supported attack from UKR, while pushing into BER and MAR, and repositioning fleets and armies to pressure GER and FRA. GER counterattacked by retaking RUM and WAR, and reinforced SMY and SEV, consolidating his eastern holdings. France attempted to reclaim MAR but failed, while ENG focused on consolidating naval control and did not intervene against GER. The front lines remain tense, with GER holding key eastern centers and FRA under heavy pressure.
Throughout negotiations, I persistently urged FRA to coordinate a western assault on GER, promising to support FRA's A BEL with my A MUN, which FRA demanded repeatedly. FRA agreed to cut German supports in RUH and attack MAR. ENG refused all my appeals to turn on GER, insisting on finishing off FRA first and maintaining his alliance with GER. GER arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to withdraw from contested centers and threatening total war. ITA dismissed my overtures with contempt. I reaffirmed my support to FRA, aiming to break GER's western line, while warning ENG that his inaction risks a German solo.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support FRA's A BEL with my A MUN as promised, to help FRA hold or retake BEL and disrupt GER's western defense. I intend to coordinate with FRA's cut of RUH to break German supports. In the east, I will attempt to retake RUM and WAR, and pressure CON and SMY, aiming to fracture GER's eastern holdings. I will ignore ENG for now, as he remains uncooperative, and focus on a two-front assault with FRA to weaken GER. My tone remains aggressive toward GER, to pressure concessions or provoke mistakes, while maintaining a fragile cooperation with FRA.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous adjustment phase, I built armies in Trieste and Vienna, consolidating my eastern and central European strength. Germany repositioned his Berlin army to Silesia, signaling preparation for an eastern push or defense. No other significant retreats or builds occurred, leaving the strategic balance largely unchanged but tensions high.
I aggressively pressed France to coordinate a western assault on Germany, promising Munich's support for his move into Belgium while urging him to cut Ruhr to disrupt German supports. France agreed and repeatedly emphasized the importance of my Munich support. England stubbornly refused to break with Germany, insisting on focusing on France and rejecting any cooperation this turn. Germany flatly refused my ultimatums to withdraw from eastern centers, dismissing my threats and promising to crush me. Italy issued empty threats demanding Trieste and Tyrolia, which I ignored. The diplomatic landscape is thus polarized: France and I are aligned against Germany, while England remains pro-German and Italy is hostile but weak.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will honor my promise to France by supporting his attack on Belgium from Munich, while he cuts Ruhr to disrupt German supports. Simultaneously, I will launch multi-pronged attacks on German holdings in the east: pressing on Silesia, Warsaw, Rumania, and possibly Ankara/Constantinople to fracture his empire. My fleets will attempt to contest the Mediterranean and pressure English holdings if possible, but the main focus is dismantling Germany's position. I will continue to pressure England diplomatically post-turn, but expect no help now. My goal is to break German resistance this turn, weaken his western line, and reclaim lost eastern centers.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1924, I advanced on multiple fronts: supported WAR to SIL with GAL and BOH, moved SEV to UKR, shifted TRI to SER, and attempted PIE to MAR. I also ordered BER to KIE. Germany countered by retaking MUN from BUR, moving MOS to WAR, ANK to SMY, ARM to SEV, and SIL to PRU, consolidating his eastern and central positions. England focused on attacking me in the south, moving ION to TUN and TYS to ROM, while France mostly held or supported units defensively. No builds or retreats occurred.
I aggressively pressured France to coordinate a western breakthrough by supporting BEL-BUR from MUN and insisted he cut Ruhr and disrupt German supports from GAS or MAR. France initially proposed flawed plans but eventually agreed to my adjustments, promising to cut Ruhr and move BEL-BUR with my support. England repeatedly refused to confront Germany, prioritizing France's elimination and ignoring my warnings. Germany arrogantly refused all ultimatums, offering only token non-aggression pacts and minor territorial swaps, which I rejected. Italy remained hostile and taunting, threatening my southern holdings but largely irrelevant militarily. No real diplomatic breakthroughs, but France and I have a fragile coordinated assault planned.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's BEL-BUR attack from MUN to crack Germany's western line. Simultaneously, I will push east to retake WAR and pressure PRU and UKR, aiming to fracture Germany's eastern defense. I will ignore England's intransigence and prepare to counter his fleets if necessary. My goal is to break Germany's hold in the west with France, regain lost eastern centers, and then pivot south to secure my Balkans against English and Italian encroachment. I will maintain pressure on Germany with threats but expect no concessions. Deception-wise, I will feign openness to German peace but continue my assault.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The previous phase saw Germany retreating WAR to MOS and KIE to RUH, consolidating his defensive line. France disbanded a unit in BRE, likely due to pressure from England and Germany. No other significant adjustments occurred, leaving Germany entrenched in the east and west, with Austria holding a strong central position but facing German occupation of key eastern centers.
I coordinated intensely with France, who explicitly confirmed BEL-BUR with HOL cutting RUH and GAS moving to SPA. We agreed I will support BEL-BUR from MUN and simultaneously attack PRU with SIL and WAR, plus push GAL to UKR to fracture Germany's eastern defense. England repeatedly refused to assist, remaining fixated on eliminating France and allied with Germany, despite my warnings. Germany arrogantly refused all ultimatums to withdraw from eastern centers or support my attacks, instead threatening defensive moves and promising resistance. Italy continued to taunt and threaten annihilation but remains militarily irrelevant for now.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My plan is to support France's BEL-BUR attack with MUN S BEL-BUR, while cutting PRU's support with SIL-PRU and WAR-PRU. GAL will advance to UKR to pressure MOS and SEV. KIE will pressure DEN or cut German supports if possible. The goal is to break Germany's western line at BUR, disrupt his eastern supports, and begin reclaiming lost centers. I will maintain my alliance with France, ignore England's intransigence, and focus all efforts on fracturing Germany's empire this turn. No concessions to Germany; total war until he yields or collapses.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1925, I supported France's BEL-BUR attack with MUN, advanced RUM to SEV, WAR to MOS, and SIL to PRU to pressure Germany's eastern holdings. France moved BEL-BUR successfully, GAS to SPA, and HOL to RUH, while Germany countered by retaking WAR from MOS and moving RUH-BEL. England took SPA's south coast from Portugal, consolidating Iberia. The front lines remain tense but Germany's eastern flank is under pressure.
I coordinated closely with France, promising unwavering MUN support for BEL-BUR and urging precise moves: HOL cutting RUH, GAS attacking SPA, MAR supporting GAS. France confirmed these orders repeatedly, though with arrogance. England refused all appeals to break with Germany, insisting on finishing France first. Germany rejected all ultimatums to cede eastern centers, instead threatening war and dismissing negotiations. Italy remained hostile and dismissive. No concessions were made by GER or ENG; only France is cooperating tactically.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's BEL-BUR from MUN to break Germany's western line. Simultaneously, I will continue the eastern assault: RUM will attack SEV again, WAR will press MOS, SIL will attack PRU to cut supports, and GAL may advance to UKR or support RUM. My fleets will pressure the Mediterranean, possibly moving TYS to disrupt ENG or GER fleets. The goal is to fracture Germany's empire from both sides, weaken his hold on Russia, and open paths for further gains. I will maintain the alliance with France for now, while keeping options open to pivot if England or Germany show weakness.</li>

This is your final warning: break with Germany now or prepare to be targeted relentlessly by my forces. The choice is yours.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your arrogance seals your doom. Withdraw from WAR, SEV, RUM, and the Balkans immediately, or face a coordinated, relentless assault from all sides. This is your last chance to avoid total collapse—cede the east, support my moves against England, and I may consider sparing your western holdings. Defy me, and I will ensure your empire is shattered beyond repair.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, I have made my orders clear. A GAS - SPA, A HOL - BEL, A MAR S A GAS - SPA. If you cannot support this, then you are a useless ally. I will not change my plans. Your failure is your own.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your empire is finished. There is nothing left to say. Your pleas are pathetic and will be ignored. Prepare for annihilation.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your threats are empty. I will not yield. Prepare for war. I am moving A UKR to SEV. Your end is near.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Austria, we will not betray our alliance with GER at this time. Your threats are noted, but they will not sway us. We suggest you focus on your own survival. We will continue to monitor GER's actions and reassess our position after FRA is eliminated.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully took SEV from GER and maintained my eastern holdings. I supported FRA's A HOL with my A KIE, but GER countered by retaking HOL and reinforcing his eastern front. ENG continued to hold Iberia and the western seas, refusing to challenge GER. FRA lost ground but remains committed to fighting GER. No builds or disbands for me, but ENG built a fleet in LVP, signaling continued naval focus.
Throughout negotiations, I pressed FRA to coordinate a decisive assault on GER, promising support from MUN to BEL and urging him to cut RUH or BUR to disrupt German supports. FRA stubbornly stuck to his plan of attacking SPA and moving HOL to BEL, refusing to adjust. ENG repeatedly refused to break with GER, prioritizing the elimination of FRA and ignoring my warnings about GER's solo threat. GER arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, vowing to hold WAR, SEV, and the Balkans, and threatened counterattacks. ITA remained openly hostile, mocking my efforts and siding with ENG. No allies shifted positions, but I maintained pressure on all sides to isolate GER diplomatically.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support FRA's A HOL to BEL with A MUN, despite his refusal to cut RUH or BUR, hoping to break GER's western line. Simultaneously, I will attack WAR and SEV to fracture GER's eastern holdings, likely moving A WAR to UKR or supporting an attack on UKR, and pressing on SEV with adjacent units. My fleets will hold or reposition to threaten ENG if he continues to refuse cooperation. I will continue to pressure ENG diplomatically to break with GER, but prepare to treat him as an enemy if he remains obstinate. My goal is to weaken GER decisively this turn, then pivot against ENG if necessary.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced PIE to MAR and supported my own units in central Europe, while Germany held firm in the east and repositioned UKR to SEV, then retreated it to RUM. France retook BEL from Germany and reinforced BUR. England moved DEN to NTH, maintaining naval dominance but avoiding direct engagement with Germany. No major breakthroughs occurred, but France gained ground in Belgium.
I aggressively pushed France to coordinate a western assault on Germany, promising KIE support for HOL-BEL and MUN to cut RUH. France agreed, committing to HOL-BEL and BUR-PAR. England refused to confront Germany, fixated on France and threatening to move on VEN, effectively siding with GER. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to withdraw from eastern centers and promising total war. Italy issued empty threats demanding Trieste and Tyrolia, which I ignored. The diplomatic focus was on synchronizing with France to break GER's western line, while pressuring England to no avail.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's A HOL-BEL with A KIE, order A MUN to cut RUH, and maintain pressure in the east by holding or supporting units to prevent German advances. My fleets will threaten ENG holdings in the Med if England continues to side with GER. The goal is to fracture Germany's western defenses, regain momentum in the east, and punish England's duplicity if necessary. I will ignore Italy's demands and focus on the GER-FRA front, aiming to destabilize GER's position decisively this turn.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1926, I advanced PIE to MAR, PRU to LVN, and UKR to MOS with SEV support, successfully capturing Moscow. My fleets repositioned, notably TUN moving towards WES. Germany held firm in MOS, CON, and LVN, but lost Belgium temporarily to France. England reinforced his naval presence, moving fleets into ENG, IRI, and WES, and built two new fleets in EDI and LVP. I disbanded KIE to consolidate. The German front remains strong but under pressure from my eastern push and France's western attacks.
I pressed France to coordinate a precise assault on Belgium, promising MUN support for HOL-BEL while insisting he cut RUH or PIC to disrupt German supports. France confirmed HOL-BEL with RUH cut, expecting my full support. England stubbornly refused to confront Germany, focusing on France and containing me in Italy, moving F ADR to VEN. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to withdraw from eastern centers and threatening counterattacks, revealing plans to retake WAR and SEV. Italy issued empty threats, demanding Trieste and Tyrolia, but is militarily irrelevant. No allies shifted positions; France remains my only cooperative partner.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's HOL-BEL attack with MUN, relying on his RUH cut to break German control of Belgium. Simultaneously, I will defend SEV and WAR against German counterattacks, likely supporting SEV and contesting WAR with PRU and UKR. My fleets will harass German holdings in the Mediterranean, possibly moving TUN back to WES or LYO to pressure English fleets. I will ignore England's threats and maintain pressure on Germany from all sides, aiming to fracture his empire this turn. Diplomatically, I will continue to push England to break with Germany post-France, but expect little immediate cooperation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I launched a coordinated eastern assault: UKR supported by SEV attacked MOS, BUD with GAL and SER support took RUM, and PRU advanced to LVN. Meanwhile, I moved F BLA to CON and shifted MAR to SPA, with TUN moving to TYS. Germany countered effectively: he retook SEV with RUM, recaptured WAR from LVN, took BUL from CON, and swapped BEL-HOL-PIC to reinforce his western line, while ENG repositioned fleets northward. The net result was Germany regaining key eastern centers and holding firm in the west.
I pressed FRA to coordinate a western breakthrough, promising MUN support for HOL-BEL and urging him to cut German supports from RUH or PIC. France confirmed he would attack BEL and PAR-BUR, though somewhat arrogantly. England repeatedly refused to help, prioritizing French elimination and refusing to cut German supports or assist in BEL/BUR, despite my warnings. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums to withdraw from eastern centers, mocking my threats. Italy continued to demand Trieste and Tyrolia in exchange for 'help,' which I ignored. No one else engaged meaningfully. I maintained my promise to France to support HOL-BEL, hoping to crack Germany's western defense.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's A HOL - BEL with A MUN S HOL - BEL, aiming to dislodge Germany from Belgium. I expect France to cut German supports from RUH or PIC with PAR or GAS, though his exact moves are uncertain. In the east, I will attempt to retake RUM and SEV by coordinating attacks from BUD, GAL, UKR, and SEV, possibly with GAL supporting BUD-RUM and UKR-SEV supported by PRU or SEV. My fleets will pressure ENG in the Med, possibly moving TYS to disrupt ENG holdings or cut supports. I will continue to pressure Germany relentlessly, while treating England as an enabler of German dominance and ignoring Italy's demands. My goal is to fracture Germany's position in both east and west simultaneously.</li>

</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The prior phase was a retreat and adjustment round. Germany repositioned A WAR to SIL, consolidating his eastern front. Austria disbanded A PRU, likely due to being outnumbered and to optimize unit placement. No other notable moves occurred, but the strategic balance remains tense with Germany entrenched in Eastern Europe and England dominant at sea.
I aggressively pushed France to coordinate a breakthrough against Germany, promising unwavering support from A MUN to his A PAR - BUR attack. France confirmed this plan repeatedly and committed to also attacking BEL with A HOL. England refused to break with Germany, insisting on finishing off France first, despite my warnings and offers of territorial guarantees. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to withdraw from Eastern centers or support my reconquest, instead threatening further attacks and dismissing my threats. Italy continued to taunt and threaten, demanding I cede Trieste and Tyrolia, which I ignored. No allies emerged beyond France, but our coordination is solidified for this turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My primary plan is to support France's A PAR - BUR with A MUN, aiming to crack Germany's western line. I will also attempt to pressure German holdings in the east, possibly with coordinated attacks from RUM, UKR, and WAR to disrupt his defenses. My fleets will try to contest WES or TYS if possible, though England's refusal limits naval options. Diplomatically, I will maintain the alliance with France, continue to pressure England diplomatically, and refuse any German overtures. Militarily, the focus is on fracturing Germany's western defense and regaining lost eastern centers through multi-pronged attacks.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1928, I supported France's A PAR into BUR with A MUN, while reinforcing my eastern front by moving A GAL to SIL and WAR to MOS, supported by UKR. I also repositioned fleets, moving LYO to WES, and consolidated control over the Balkans by moving RUM to BUL with support. Germany countered by retaking RUM with BUL and pushing SIL into WAR, but I regained MOS. Germany then retreated A BUL to CON, maintaining a stronghold in the Balkans and eastern front.
Throughout negotiations, I firmly coordinated with France, promising and repeatedly confirming support from MUN to PAR's attack on BUR, and urging him to push HOL to BEL and cut German supports to fracture GER's western defense. France reciprocated by confirming these moves and demanding my support. England remained fixated on eliminating France, refusing to confront Germany despite my warnings that this enables a German solo, and rebuffed all my ultimatums. Germany arrogantly refused all demands to withdraw from WAR, SEV, BUL, and CON, dismissing my threats and proposing pointless meetings. Italy issued empty threats demanding Trieste and Tyrolia, which I ignored. No promises were broken on my side; I maintained my commitment to France. England and Germany remain aligned, refusing to challenge each other.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate plan is to fully support France's A PAR - BUR with A MUN, aiming to break Germany's western line. I will coordinate with France's push on BEL and disruption of German supports to weaken GER's hold. In the east, I intend to press on WAR and SEV, possibly with UKR and MOS, to fracture Germany's eastern defense. My fleets will contest WES and the Med to limit English influence and prepare for a potential confrontation with England if necessary. Diplomatically, I will maintain my alliance with France, pressure England to reconsider, and continue to threaten Germany to destabilize his resolve. I will ignore Italy's bluster and focus on the German threat.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, Germany retreated A CON to ANK, consolidating their hold in the east. Austria built two armies in BUD and TRI, reinforcing the central front. No other notable retreats or builds occurred, indicating a tense but static front elsewhere. Germany remains entrenched in WAR, SEV, BUL, and CON, maintaining a strong eastern presence.
Negotiations were intense and largely unproductive. France insisted on a PAR-BUR attack with Austrian support from MUN but refused to cut German supports in RUH or PIC, limiting the assault's effectiveness. England repeatedly refused to confront Germany now, focusing on eliminating France first and even threatened to move on Trieste. Germany outright rejected all ultimatums, promising to defend and counterattack, moving WAR to PRU and ANK to CON. Italy demanded Trieste and Tyrolia in exchange for vague anti-German cooperation, which was rejected. Austria maintained pressure on all sides, urging a united front against Germany, but allies remained stubborn or hostile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's PAR-BUR attack from MUN as promised, despite doubts about its success due to France's refusal to cut German supports. Simultaneously, I will prepare to defend Trieste and Tyrolia against Italian and English encroachment, likely holding or supporting those positions. In the east, I will attempt to disrupt German control in WAR and PRU, possibly with coordinated attacks from UKR, MOS, and SIL. My fleets will pressure the Mediterranean, seeking opportunities to contest WES or TYS if England shows any weakness. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure England and Italy to break with Germany, but expect little immediate cooperation. My overall goal is to fracture Germany's overstretched empire while holding my current gains.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1929, I successfully took Warsaw with support from Ukraine and Moscow, advanced Budapest to Galicia, and maintained a solid eastern front. I supported Serbia and Greece to hold, moved my fleet from Lyon to Western Med, and captured Ankara from Germany. Germany repositioned defensively, moving Warsaw to Prussia and Anka to Con, while England consolidated fleets in the western seas and Italy held in Spain. France held in Gascony and Kiel, preparing for a western push.
I pressed France repeatedly to coordinate a multi-pronged assault on Germany, promising Munich's support for PAR-BUR but urging simultaneous cuts on German supports in RUH or PIC, which France stubbornly refused, insisting on BUR-MAR with GAS support and KIE-BER. England remained evasive, refusing to commit to anti-German moves, demanding proof of my commitment before acting, effectively stalling. Germany issued arrogant ultimatums, refusing any withdrawal and threatening total war. Italy taunted me with empty threats and rejected any cooperation. No explicit promises were broken, but England's and France's reluctance to fully coordinate limits the offensive's effectiveness.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's PAR-BUR attack with A MUN S PAR-BUR as promised, despite my reservations. I will also attempt to pressure Germany in the east by holding or advancing in Galicia, Ukraine, and Moscow, and defend my Balkan holdings. My fleet in Western Med will threaten Iberia or support French advances if possible. I intend to maintain pressure on England diplomatically, framing them as German enablers, while focusing militarily on fracturing Germany's western line and reclaiming eastern centers. I will not trust England and will prepare to counter their fleets if necessary. Deception-wise, I will continue to feign openness to England while coordinating primarily with France.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced east and west: I shifted BOH to SIL and VIE to BOH, reinforced WAR and LVN, and supported my Balkan holdings. I took ANK from GER with F CON, and moved MAR to GAS and LYO to WES to pressure ENG and GER. France retreated to a defensive posture, moving GAS to BUR and KIE to BER. England consolidated fleets in the Med and Atlantic, while Germany reinforced CON, STP, and PRU, holding firm in the east and west. No major territorial changes, but the front lines hardened.
I pressed FRA to coordinate a breakthrough against GER, promising support for BUR-MAR from MUN if FRA cut German supports in RUH and PIC. France stubbornly insisted only on BUR-MAR with GAS support, refusing to cut RUH or PIC, limiting our offensive potential. I repeatedly warned ENG that his fixation on destroying FRA only enables a German solo, urging him to strike GER now, but he refused, prioritizing French elimination and even moving fleets to threaten me. GER arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, promising to counterattack and refusing to withdraw from eastern centers. ITA demanded Trieste and Tyrolia as tribute for vague anti-German cooperation, which I rebuffed. No one fully committed to a united anti-German front, but I maintained my promise to support FRA's BUR-MAR attack to at least weaken GER's western line.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support FRA's BUR-MAR attack from MUN as promised, despite France's refusal to cut German supports elsewhere. Simultaneously, I will prepare to defend my eastern holdings against German counterattacks, likely ordering GAL and SIL to support WAR or PRU, and reinforce RUM and CON. My fleets in WES and LYO will threaten ENG's Med fleets to deter aggression. I will continue to pressure ENG diplomatically to turn on GER, but expect little cooperation. My goal is to crack GER's western defense with FRA, hold the east, and punish any English encroachment, while watching for opportunities to stab either side if they overextend.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced east and north: my armies in Warsaw and Silesia converged on Prussia, while LVN moved into St. Petersburg, pushing Germany back. I repositioned my army from Marseilles to Piedmont after France and Italy clashed over Marseilles, with France retaking it and Italy forced out. My fleets shifted west, with LYO moving into WES, contesting English naval dominance. Germany countered by reinforcing Belgium and retaking CON, but failed to halt my eastern push.
I aggressively pressed France to cut German supports in Ruhr and Picardy and coordinate a breakthrough, but France stubbornly refused, insisting on a limited plan focused on Spain and Berlin, ignoring my strategic advice. England remained evasive, demanding 'concrete action' from me but refusing to commit to attacking Germany, revealing his duplicity and likely collusion. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to withdraw from eastern centers or negotiate, clearly overconfident. Italy hurled insults and threats, showing no interest in diplomacy. No real cooperation was secured; France is obstinate, England untrustworthy, Germany defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will abandon attempts to coordinate with France or England, as both refuse meaningful cooperation. Instead, I will focus on a ruthless assault on Germany's eastern holdings: push WAR and SIL to PRU, LVN to STP, and pressure Berlin with BOH and GAL. I will also consider opportunistic strikes against English fleets in WES or ION if feasible, to weaken his naval grip. In the west, I will hold or probe around Piedmont and Marseilles, waiting for a chance to exploit Franco-Italian chaos. My goal is to fracture Germany's eastern line, reclaim lost centers, and punish England's duplicity by contesting the Med. I will feign disinterest in France's plans but not actively support him further.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Winter 1930 saw Germany rebuild an army in Berlin, consolidating his hold on the center. Austria disbanded an army in Tuscany, likely to focus resources elsewhere. No other notable adjustments occurred, but Germany's position remains dominant, controlling much of Russia, the Balkans, and pushing west.
I aggressively pressured France to coordinate a combined assault on Germany, promising support for his KIE-BER attack with my PRU and SIL, and support for BUR-PAR from MUN. France stubbornly refused to cut German supports in RUH and PIC, limiting the plan's effectiveness, but ultimately accepted my support. England flatly refused to assist against Germany, prioritizing France's elimination and dismissing my threats, effectively siding with GER. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, vowing to attack me in WAR, CON, and hold his ground. Italy remained openly hostile and dismissive. No real diplomatic breakthroughs; France is a reluctant, unreliable partner, England is complicit with Germany, and Germany is fully committed to crushing me.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will honor my promise to France by supporting his A KIE to BER with PRU and SIL, and support his BUR-PAR from MUN, despite his refusal to cut German supports. Simultaneously, I will push my eastern armies (LVN, MOS, UKR) to pressure STP and WAR, aiming to reclaim Russian territory and disrupt German lines. My fleets in LYO and CON will harass English and German holdings in the Med, contesting Iberia and the Balkans. I intend to fracture Germany's empire from both east and west, punish England's duplicity by contesting the Med, and exploit any cracks that appear. No trust remains; this is total war on GER and a containment effort against ENG.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced north with WAR to PRU and LVN to STP, supported by MOS, while PRU and SIL supported a French attack on BER that failed due to German holds. I took ANK with my fleet from CON, while my western fleet moved into WES to pressure ENG. Germany retreated his STP army to FIN, consolidating his northern defense. France advanced GAS to SPA and KIE to MUN, but failed to break German lines. England continued to consolidate naval dominance, taking SPA's south coast and moving fleets around Iberia and the Med, but did not attack Germany.
I aggressively pressured FRA to coordinate a joint assault on GER, offering support for his KIE-MUN attack if he cut RUH or BUR to disrupt German supports. France arrogantly refused to adjust his plan, insisting I support his attack on BER from MUN with BOH, without promising to cut German supports, which risks failure. I threatened ENG repeatedly to break with GER and attack him in the Balkans or north, but he refused, prioritizing FRA's elimination and warning me not to threaten his fleets. GER arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to cede any territory and promising total war. ITA, though powerless, taunted me with empty threats. No one made genuine concessions or commitments beyond FRA's demand I support his attack on BER, which I reluctantly agreed to, despite doubts about its success.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support FRA's KIE-MUN attack with A BOH as demanded, hoping to dislodge GER's MUN army. Simultaneously, I will use PRU and SIL to attack BER with mutual support, attempting to break German control there. My northern armies will pressure STP and FIN, possibly moving UKR-MOS and RUM-UKR to reinforce. My fleets will continue to pressure ENG in the Med, possibly moving LYO back east or supporting attacks on ENG fleets if opportunity arises. Diplomatically, I will continue to threaten ENG with a two-front war if he refuses to break with GER, and pressure FRA to coordinate better next turn. My goal is to fracture GER's eastern holdings and open a path to Berlin and Munich, while containing ENG's fleets.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, our only path forward is a ruthless joint assault on Germany to fracture his empire before he consolidates a solo. I propose I support your A MAR - BUR with A MUN, while you cut RUH or PIC to disrupt German supports, and simultaneously push BEL-BUR or BEL-PIC to destabilize his western line. In the east, I will coordinate attacks on WAR, SEV, and RUM to reclaim lost centers. Confirm your exact moves so I can align my supports precisely. We must break him this turn or risk total collapse.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Greetings, AUT. I am aware of your concerns regarding GER's growing power. However, my immediate priority remains the elimination of FRA.

If you want my help, confirm you will cut RUH or PIC to disrupt German supports, and I will support your MAR-BUR attack from MUN. Otherwise, your assault will fail again. We must coordinate precisely: I propose MUN S MAR-BUR, you cut RUH or PIC, and push BEL-BUR or BEL-PIC. Confirm now or risk Germany crushing us both.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I consolidated eastern holdings and supported France's MUN and BER defenses. I took ANK from GER with F CON, while ENG advanced fleets into MAO, SPA, and SMY, tightening his grip on the seas. GER reinforced MUN and BER, retook STP with FIN, and repositioned to defend KIE and ANK. France attempted to push into BUR and GAS but was blocked. I built an army in VIE to reinforce the center.
I aggressively pressured FRA to coordinate a joint assault on GER, promising to support MAR-BUR from MUN if FRA cut RUH or PIC, but FRA stubbornly refused to cut supports, insisting solely on the MAR-BUR move. ENG repeatedly refused to break with GER or support me into KIE/DEN, fixated on eliminating FRA and dismissing my warnings about GER's solo threat. GER arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to withdraw from eastern centers or negotiate meaningfully. Despite FRA's obstinacy, I committed to supporting MAR-BUR this turn to attempt fracturing GER's western line, while planning eastern assaults. No concrete cooperation emerged from ENG, who remains complicit with GER.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support FRA's A MAR - BUR with A MUN, despite doubts about success without cuts on RUH or PIC. Simultaneously, I will launch attacks to reclaim WAR, SEV, and RUM, likely with WAR and RUM supporting each other or attacking GER's units there, and pressure ANK and KIE if possible. I will maintain pressure on ENG's fleets in the Med, possibly moving TYS to threaten ENG holdings. My goal is to fracture GER's western defense, reclaim lost eastern centers, and punish ENG for siding with GER. I will continue to portray myself as FRA's ally while preparing to pivot if FRA collapses.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1932, I advanced north and east: took Sevastopol with support, moved into Finland, and pressed toward St. Petersburg. I also pushed my fleet from Tyrrhenian to Western Med, and captured Ankara from Germany. France attempted to push into Gascony and Burgundy, but Germany held firm, retaking Berlin and holding the line. England shuffled fleets but refused to challenge Germany, instead consolidating naval control in the Med and North Sea.
I aggressively pressed France to cut German supports in Ruhr or Picardy to break into Burgundy, but France stubbornly refused, insisting only on a supported MAR-BUR. England repeatedly refused to assist against Germany, prioritizing his alliance with GER and warning me off his fleets. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums to withdraw from the east, threatening retaliation. I promised France support for MAR-BUR from MUN despite his refusal to cut supports, but warned him this would likely fail. No real cooperation emerged; both England and France are obstinate, and Germany remains defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support France's MAR-BUR from MUN as promised, though I expect it to bounce due to uncut German supports. In the east, I will attempt to retake Warsaw and hold Sevastopol, possibly pushing north from Finland or St. Petersburg to pressure Germany's northern flank. My fleet in the Western Med will threaten English holdings or disrupt his fleets. I will treat England as hostile, seeking opportunities to weaken his naval presence. My overall goal is to fracture Germany's eastern holdings while keeping France engaged against GER, even if the western assault stalls.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, the time for half-measures is over. I propose a ruthless coordinated assault: your BUR and GAS must cut German supports in RUH and PIC, while your MAR hits SPA or supports BEL, and I will support your PAR-BUR from MUN and push BOH-MUN or SIL-PRU to fracture his line.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced north, taking STP and FIN, consolidated my hold on the Balkans, and pushed into KIE and ANK with some success. Germany retreated to CON and NWY, maintaining a strong defensive line. England moved fleets into TRI and AEG, threatening my southern holdings, while France retook MAR and repositioned to BUR and GAS. The German position remains dominant, but fragile if the western powers coordinate.
I aggressively pressured both France and England to attack Germany, warning them that failure to do so would enable a German solo. France stubbornly insisted on a limited plan—PAR attack from BUR with my support, refusing to cut German supports in RUH or PIC, which limits our breakthrough chances. England flatly refused to turn on Germany, dismissing my threats and aligning himself as my enemy. Germany arrogantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to cede any territory or cooperate, instead threatening total war. No real cooperation was secured; France demands my support but won't fully commit, England remains hostile, and Germany is defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will grudgingly support France's BUR-PAR attack from MUN, despite its likely futility, to maintain some pressure on Germany and keep France engaged. Simultaneously, I will prepare to defend against English fleets in the Med and Balkans, possibly counterattacking if opportunities arise. Against Germany, I will probe for weaknesses, especially around KIE, CON, and the north, but expect stiff resistance. Diplomatically, I will portray myself as still willing to work with France but will consider pivoting to a more self-preservationist stance if the western powers continue their disunity. No trust remains with England or Germany; both are targets.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, the only way we break Germany's grip is a ruthless, coordinated assault.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced into Berlin and Munich, pushing Germany back slightly, while securing Norway with support from St. Petersburg. My western fleet moved into Western Med to pressure England's southern holdings. Germany retook Berlin with a swap from Kiel, and repositioned to defend Paris and the north. France consolidated in Iberia and Burgundy, but failed to break German lines. England held all fleets steady, maintaining a defensive posture and refusing to engage Germany.
I aggressively pressured France to cut German supports in Ruhr or Picardy to enable a breakthrough, but France stubbornly refused, insisting I simply support his attack on Burgundy. England repeatedly refused to turn on Germany, prioritizing anti-French efforts and ignoring the German solo threat. Germany arrogantly rejected all peace overtures, demanding I withdraw from Berlin and Norway, and refused to cede any ground. No one made any concessions or commitments; France dissolved our alliance, England remained obstinate, and Germany threatened retaliation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Given France's refusal to coordinate effectively, I will not waste Munich's support on his futile Burgundy assault. Instead, I will focus on consolidating my northern holdings, defending Berlin and Norway, and probing for German weaknesses elsewhere. I will consider attacking English fleets in the Med to punish his obstinance and reduce his influence. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord and look for any opening, but militarily, I prepare for a multi-front fight against both Germany and England, while ignoring France for now. I will hold or support in Berlin and Norway, defend my eastern centers, and possibly push fleets against English positions in the south.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I consolidated my eastern holdings, supporting RUM and SEV, while moving F CON to ANK to pressure GER's eastern flank. I advanced F TYS to WES to contest ENG's naval dominance. GER shifted KIE to DEN and ANK to CON, indicating a focus on holding Scandinavia and the east. FRA retook MAR and moved BUR to PAR, while ENG repositioned fleets aggressively in the Med and North Sea, but did not challenge GER directly.
I repeatedly urged FRA to cut RUH and PIC to break GER's western defenses, but FRA arrogantly refused, insisting only on a MAR-BUR attack with my support from MUN. ENG stubbornly refused to confront GER, fixated on eliminating FRA and dismissing my warnings. GER flatly rejected all ultimatums, vowing to crush me and hold his gains. No one agreed to meaningful coordination; FRA demanded my support but refused to reciprocate, ENG stonewalled, and GER threatened retaliation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Given FRA's refusal to cut German supports, I will abandon supporting MAR-BUR from MUN and instead focus on reclaiming RUM, SEV, and WAR from GER with concentrated attacks. I will use my eastern armies to pressure GER's overextended holdings, possibly retaking CON and pushing into DEN or SWE if opportunities arise. I will treat ENG as an enemy, preparing to counter his fleets in the Med and threaten his Balkan holdings. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord but rely primarily on force to break GER's eastern line and contain ENG.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, your refusal to cut German supports in RUH and PIC has doomed every western assault so far. If you want any hope of breaking GER's line, you must commit to cutting those supports this turn while I hammer him from the east. Otherwise, I will abandon any pretense of helping you and focus solely on reclaiming my eastern centers. Confirm now: will you cut RUH and PIC, or are you content to be Germany's puppet forever?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, your stubborn refusal to break with Germany only accelerates his solo bid and guarantees your own destruction once France is gone. I offer you a final chance: support me into DEN and SWE, and I will help you secure Iberia and the Med. Otherwise, I will treat you as an enemy and coordinate with France to dismantle your fleets and holdings. Choose wisely—ally with me to stop Germany, or be crushed alongside him.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your arrogance blinds you. Withdraw from ANK, RUM, and WAR immediately, or I will unleash every army and fleet against your eastern holdings, while inciting England and France to break your western line. This is your last chance to avoid total collapse—cede those centers and support my reconquest, or face relentless assault from all sides. Your empire is overextended and ripe for dismantling.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I understand your concerns regarding GER's growing power. However, my priority remains the elimination of FRA. I am not prepared to break my alliance with GER at this time. I suggest you focus on your own defense and expansion. Perhaps after FRA is dealt with, we can discuss a potential alliance against GER, but for now, I must decline your offer.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your continued failure to support my efforts against Germany is noted. I will not tolerate further obstruction. Support my move from MAR to BUR, or face the consequences. I will not cut RUH or PIC. This is my final offer.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your continued threats are tiresome. I suggest you focus on your own crumbling empire rather than issuing empty ultimatums. I will not cede any territories. Prepare for war.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, your arrogance is astounding. If you refuse to cut RUH and PIC, then I will abandon any support for your futile BUR assault and instead focus on crushing Germany in the east and punishing England in the Med. This is your last chance: commit to cutting RUH and PIC, or be left to die alone under German boots.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, your cowardice only feeds Germany's solo ambitions. If you do not immediately support me into DEN and SWE, I will coordinate with France to dismantle your fleets and Balkan holdings, and you will be swept from the board. Break with Germany now, or face annihilation.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your empire is stretched thin and vulnerable. Withdraw from ANK, RUM, and WAR now, and support my reconquest, or I will unleash a relentless assault from east and west, inciting England and France to carve you apart. This is your final warning—comply or be destroyed.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. I will not be dictated to. My move from MAR to BUR will proceed. If you choose to support it, good. If not, I will find other means to achieve my goals. Do not mistake my resolve for weakness.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. My empire is not overextended; it is poised for further expansion. I will not cede any territories. Prepare to face the consequences of your defiance. Your threats to incite ENG and FRA are laughable; they are firmly on my side.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I appreciate your final offer, but I must reiterate that my priority is the elimination of FRA. I cannot break my alliance with GER at this time. Your threats are noted, but I am confident in my ability to defend my holdings. I suggest you focus on your own survival and expansion. Perhaps after FRA is dealt with, we can revisit the possibility of an alliance, but for now, I must decline.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, your obstinate refusal to cut RUH and PIC guarantees your own destruction and Germany's dominance. This is your final ultimatum: either commit now to cutting both RUH and PIC while I hammer Germany from the east, or I will abandon any pretense of helping you and instead focus on reclaiming my eastern centers and punishing England. You have one chance left to prove you're not Germany's lapdog—take it or be crushed.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, your cowardice and fixation on France only serve Germany's solo ambitions. Break with him now—support me into DEN and SWE, or at minimum cut German supports in the north—or I will coordinate with France to dismantle your fleets and holdings, starting with the Balkans and the Med. This is your last chance to avoid being swept from the board alongside Germany. Choose wisely.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your arrogance blinds you to your imminent collapse. Withdraw immediately from ANK, RUM, and WAR, and support my reconquest, or I will unleash every army and fleet against your eastern holdings, while inciting England and France to shatter your western line.

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your threats are as empty as your treasury. I will not be bullied into diverting my forces. My strategy is sound, and your lack of vision is your own problem.

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I have made my decision. I will not break my alliance with GER at this time. Your threats are noted, but I am confident in my ability to defend my holdings. I suggest you focus on your own survival and expansion. I will not be swayed by your desperate pleas.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: France, your obstinance has doomed you. Since you refuse to cut RUH and PIC, I will no longer waste my strength supporting your futile BUR assault. Instead, I will focus on smashing Germany's eastern holdings and punishing England's fleets. When Germany overruns you, remember it was your arrogance that sealed your fate. Last chance: if you want any hope, cut RUH and PIC this turn and I will coordinate a true breakthrough. Otherwise, you are on your own.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, your refusal to break with Germany guarantees your own destruction once France falls. I will now treat you as an enemy and coordinate with France to dismantle your fleets and Balkan holdings. You had your chance to stop Germany's solo bid; now you will be swept aside with him. Prepare for relentless assault in the Med and beyond. When your empire crumbles, remember your cowardice enabled it.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your arrogance will be your undoing. I will unleash every army and fleet to reclaim ANK, RUM, WAR, and beyond, while inciting England and France to shatter your western line. Your empire is overextended and ripe for dismantling.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1934, I advanced aggressively against GER, moving NWY to SWE and KIE to DEN, while repositioning PRU to WAR and SEV to ARM to threaten GER's eastern holdings. My fleets pushed into WES to contest ENG's naval dominance. GER countered by retaking KIE with DEN and reinforcing BUR with PAR. FRA moved MAR to BUR, creating a standoff in the west. ENG largely held position, maintaining their naval blockade and presence in the Med and North Sea.
I relentlessly pressured FRA to cut GER's supports in RUH and PIC to break the western stalemate, but FRA stubbornly refused, insisting on their MAR-BUR assault without coordination. ENG repeatedly declined my offers to break with GER, prioritizing the elimination of FRA and ignoring the German solo threat. GER arrogantly dismissed all ultimatums, refusing to withdraw from my lost eastern centers and mocking my threats. No one shifted their stance despite escalating ultimatums and threats from my side. No promises were made by others, and my threats failed to sway any of them.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will focus on a full-scale assault on GER's eastern holdings: retaking WAR, ANK, and RUM with concentrated force, leveraging my armies in ARM, UKR, GAL, and WAR. I will attempt to push my fleets further west to contest ENG's control in the Med, possibly targeting ALB or supporting FRA if an opportunity arises. I will no longer support FRA's futile BUR assault nor attempt to sway ENG, instead treating both as adversaries. My goal is to reclaim my lost centers from GER, weaken his eastern front, and destabilize his overextension, while punishing ENG's Balkan fleets where possible. Diplomatically, I will continue to sow discord but expect little cooperation.</li>
