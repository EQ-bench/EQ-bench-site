<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings Italy! I propose we establish a strong Central-Southern alliance to secure the Balkans and prevent early conflict. I will focus on Serbia and Greece, leaving you free to take Tunis and potentially push west. To build trust, I will not move to Venice or Tyrolia if you agree not to move to Trieste or attack me. Let's coordinate so we both grow quickly without clashing.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I suggest we pursue a peaceful start and coordinate Balkan expansion. I am interested in Serbia and Greece, and happy for you to take Rumania uncontested. If you avoid Galicia in Spring, I will not move there either, ensuring a demilitarized zone. This way, we can focus on other fronts and avoid costly early conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, how about an early understanding? I propose a division of the Balkans where I take Serbia and Greece, and you focus on Bulgaria and possibly Rumania. If we avoid conflict, we can both expand and later discuss a joint move against Russia or Italy. Let me know if you are interested in such a cooperative approach.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, we share a border and a potential interest in the Balkans. I am considering a move into Bulgaria. What are your intentions in the region? Perhaps we can come to an understanding to avoid conflict.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To Austria, greetings. I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. Let us focus on other threats before turning on each other. I am particularly interested in securing my eastern flank. What are your intentions regarding Trieste?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I propose a mutual defense agreement. We share a border and common interests. Let's agree to support each other against any aggression from France or Italy. I am particularly concerned about French expansionism. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Austria, Russia is willing to consider a temporary alliance against Germany. We both have interests in the Balkans and Poland. If you are willing to cooperate, we can coordinate our movements to put pressure on Germany. What are your thoughts on a joint attack on GAL?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your non-aggression proposal. I will not move to Venice or Tyrolia if you agree not to enter Trieste or attack me. My plan is to take Serbia and then Greece, leaving you free to secure Tunis and look west. If you confirm, we can formalize this DMZ and perhaps coordinate against Turkey or even Russia later.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I am open to cooperation but attacking Galicia risks immediate conflict. Instead, let's agree to leave Galicia empty this Spring. You can take Rumania uncontested, and I will focus on Serbia and Greece. Once we secure these, we can discuss coordinated pressure on Germany or Turkey. Confirm if you accept this DMZ and peaceful Balkan division.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I intend to move toward Serbia and Greece, leaving Bulgaria for you. If you agree not to interfere in Greece or Serbia, I will not contest Bulgaria or Black Sea. This sets us up for rapid growth and a potential alliance against Russia or Italy. Let's avoid early clashes and instead carve up the Balkans efficiently.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal for a Central-Southern alliance is intriguing. I agree to not move to Trieste if you agree to not move to Venice or Tyrolia. Let's coordinate our moves. I suggest you focus on Serbia, and I will aim for Tunis. How does that sound?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Austria, your proposal for a peaceful start is noted. However, Russia cannot guarantee avoiding GAL if it becomes strategically necessary. We are primarily interested in RUM and NWY. If you are willing to allow us free reign in these areas, we can consider a demilitarized zone in GAL. What are your intentions regarding Italy?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your proposal for dividing the Balkans is acceptable as a starting point. I agree to focus on BUL and RUM, while you take SER and GRE. However, I expect your support in securing BUL. I also want assurances that you will not interfere with my expansion into RUM. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure mutual success. What are your specific plans for SER and GRE?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I accept your proposal fully: I will not move to Venice or Tyrolia, and you refrain from Trieste. I will focus on Serbia and then Greece, leaving you free to secure Tunis and look west. Once we both grow, we can discuss a joint strike on Turkey or Russia. Let's formalize this Central-Southern alliance and coordinate to dominate the Mediterranean and Balkans.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I agree to leave Bulgaria uncontested for you, and I will focus on Serbia and Greece. In exchange, I expect you not to interfere in Greece or Serbia, and I will not oppose your move into Rumania. If you support me into Greece after you secure Bulgaria, we can quickly expand and then consider a joint attack on Russia or Italy. Confirm if you agree to this division and cooperation.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I propose a clear deal: you take Rumania uncontested, I take Serbia and Greece, and we both leave Galicia empty this Spring. This avoids early conflict and lets us expand. Once we secure these centers, we can coordinate pressure on Germany or Turkey. If you insist on Galicia, I will be forced to contest it, which benefits neither of us. Confirm peaceful intentions and DMZ in Galicia.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I agree to your proposal. I will not interfere in SER or GRE, and you will not contest BUL or the Black Sea. I propose the following moves: F ANK to BLA, A CON to BUL, and A SMY to ARM. This secures BUL for me. What are your specific moves for VIE, BUD, and TRI? Let's coordinate to avoid any misunderstandings.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I confirm our agreement. I will not move to Trieste, and you will not move to Venice or Tyrolia. I will focus on Tunis. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure mutual success. I suggest A VIE to Serbia and F TRI to ADR. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Austria, Russia cannot guarantee avoiding GAL if strategically necessary. We are primarily interested in RUM and NWY. If you are willing to allow us free reign in these areas, we can consider a demilitarized zone in GAL. However, we need a firm commitment from you to focus on SER and GRE and not interfere with our expansion. What is your final position on this matter?</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I will move A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB, leaving BUL uncontested for you. I expect you to take BUL with A CON and support me into GRE in the Fall. I will keep A VIE in place or move it south, not north. Let's solidify this Balkan division and prepare to strike Russia or Italy once we both grow. Confirm your moves and support for Fall.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I will not touch VEN or TYR, and you avoid TRI. I will move A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and likely A VIE south or hold. You focus on Tunis and west. Once we secure our builds, we can coordinate a joint assault on Turkey or Russia. Our alliance hinges on trust and rapid expansion, so let's stick to this plan.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, since you refuse to guarantee Galicia, I will treat it as contested. I will prioritize Serbia and Greece, but if you enter GAL, expect resistance. If you truly want peace, leave GAL empty and take RUM uncontested. Otherwise, I will coordinate with Turkey and possibly Germany to contain you. The choice is yours.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Austria, Russia will move F SEV to RUM, A MOS to SEV, A WAR to UKR, and F STP/SC to NWY. We expect you to focus on SER and GRE and leave GAL empty. If you contest GAL, we will reconsider our agreement with Germany and Turkey. Confirm your peaceful intentions.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I agree to your terms. I will not interfere in SER or GRE, and you will not contest BUL or the Black Sea. I propose: F ANK to BLA, A CON to BUL, A SMY to ARM. I will support you into GRE after securing BUL. Confirm your moves for VIE, BUD, and TRI. Let's coordinate for mutual success.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I confirm our agreement. I will move A ROM to TUS, F NAP to ION, and A VEN to APU. This secures my position for Tunis. I expect you to move A VIE to Serbia and F TRI to ADR as discussed. Let's crush the Balkans together!</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> No moves have yet occurred; this is Spring 1901. Initial diplomatic contacts were made with Italy, Russia, and Turkey to avoid early conflict and coordinate Balkan expansion. Germany reached out proposing mutual defense, but no concrete agreements were made with them.
I secured a non-aggression pact with Italy: no moves to Venice, Tyrolia, or Trieste, enabling us both to expand peacefully. With Turkey, we agreed I take Serbia and Greece, while Turkey takes Bulgaria and Rumania, with Turkey promising support into Greece in the Fall. Russia refused to guarantee Galicia's neutrality, so I warned that any incursion would be met with resistance. Russia outlined moves focusing on Rumania and Scandinavia but remained ambiguous on Galicia. Turkey and Italy confirmed their peaceful intentions and specific moves, while Russia remained non-committal on Galicia. No explicit promises were broken, but Russia's hedging on Galicia raises suspicion.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will move A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB, aiming to secure Serbia and position for Greece in the Fall. A VIE will likely hold or move south defensively, wary of Russian moves into Galicia. I intend to honor the DMZ with Italy and coordinate with Turkey for mutual Balkan gains, while remaining vigilant against Russian duplicity. If Russia enters Galicia, I will consider aligning with Turkey and Germany to contain Russia. My immediate goal is rapid Balkan expansion without provoking early wars on multiple fronts.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Greetings friend, the board is tense but our Balkan understanding remains my priority. I propose I take Serbia and Greece this fall, while you secure Bulgaria and Rumania. To ensure this, would you be willing to support my F ALB into Greece with your A BUL or F BLA? In exchange, I will not contest Bulgaria or Rumania and will back your southern expansion. Let's solidify this cooperation now to prevent Russian or Italian interference and dominate the Balkans together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Ciao! Our DMZ and peaceful border held perfectly. With Turkey and Russia both eyeing the Balkans, I suggest we coordinate to keep them in check. I plan to take Serbia and Greece; your fleet in ION could either support me into Greece or move west to pressure France. If you prefer, I will guarantee Trieste remains untouched and will not move against Venice or Tyrolia. Let's ensure mutual growth and avoid any misunderstandings—your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, with Russia's aggressive positioning in Ukraine and Rumania, I sense a threat brewing. If Russia pushes south or east, it benefits neither of us. Are you interested in a loose anti-Russian understanding? You could pressure Warsaw or Sweden while I contest Rumania and Galicia. Coordinated pressure now could contain Russia early, opening growth paths for us both. Let me know if you're interested in discussing specifics.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria. As agreed, we are moving to secure Bulgaria. We anticipate your move into Serbia. Do you still intend to move into Greece this fall?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, I trust our agreement holds firm. I am considering a move to Tunis with my fleet. This will secure our southern flank and allow us to focus on other matters. I will not move to Trieste. Do you have any concerns?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I see you have moved into GAL. I am willing to discuss a potential non-aggression pact, but I need assurances that you will not interfere with my expansion into the Balkans. What are your intentions regarding RUM and SER?

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, yes, my plan remains to secure Serbia and Greece this fall. To ensure this, I propose your A BUL supports my F ALB into Greece, guaranteeing us both a build. In exchange, I will not contest Bulgaria or Rumania, leaving you free to expand east or south. Russia's fleet in Rumania threatens us both; if you agree to this support, I can also pressure Galicia or Ukraine to keep Russia contained. Let's lock this in now and dominate the Balkans together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your move to Tunis is perfect and confirms our peaceful intentions. With Turkey likely supporting me into Greece, I propose you keep ION or move west to pressure France, avoiding any accidental clashes. If Turkey betrays or Russia threatens, we can coordinate a swift response. I guarantee Trieste remains untouched and will not move against Venice or Tyrolia. Let's keep this southern front stable so we can both grow elsewhere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I see your fleet in Rumania and army in Ukraine. If you want a non-aggression pact, I need your assurance you won't contest Serbia or Greece, and will focus north instead. If you agree, I will not interfere in your northern expansion or Sevastopol. Otherwise, I will coordinate with Turkey and Germany to contain you. The choice is yours: peaceful coexistence or conflict.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria. I am amenable to supporting ALB into GRE with BUL. However, I cannot guarantee Rumania. Russia has already moved there. I suggest we focus on securing our initial agreement: you get SER and GRE, I get BUL. Let's solidify this cooperation now.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, excellent, let's finalize: your A BUL supports my F ALB into GRE this fall, guaranteeing us both a build. I will not contest BUL or RUM, and will focus on containing Russia in Galicia and Ukraine. This cooperation secures the Balkans for us and sets up a strong alliance. Confirm your support order so we can coordinate perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your support from ION into Greece would be invaluable and cements our alliance. If you provide that, I guarantee Trieste remains untouched and will back your western ambitions. Alternatively, if Turkey supports me instead, I propose you move ION west or hold, avoiding conflict. Either way, let's keep our border peaceful and coordinate against any threats.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, last chance for peace: if you agree to leave Serbia and Greece uncontested and focus north, I will withdraw from Galicia and not interfere in your northern expansion. Otherwise, I will coordinate with Turkey, Italy, and Germany to contain you on all fronts. Your move—cooperation or conflict?</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I am willing to consider a non-aggression pact. However, I will not guarantee that I won't contest SER or GRE. My primary focus is securing my southern territories, and that includes the Balkans. I propose a DMZ in GAL and a guarantee of non-interference in RUM. If you agree to these terms, I will not interfere with your expansion in other areas. What is your response?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree to support your move into Greece. I will keep my fleet in ION to provide support. I expect you to honor our DMZ and support my expansion into Tunis.

After this, I am open to assisting you against Russia in Sevastopol, but first let's ensure the Balkan gains. Confirm your support order and we will dominate the southeast together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, since Turkey has agreed to support me into Greece, I suggest you either hold in ION or move west to Tunis, avoiding any clash. Our DMZ remains firm, and I will not touch Trieste or Venice. Once the Balkans stabilize, we can coordinate to contain Turkey or Russia if needed. Let's keep our alliance strong and borders peaceful.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Russia refuses to back down in the Balkans and is positioning aggressively. I propose we coordinate pressure: you push on Warsaw or Sweden, while I contest Rumania and Galicia. Early containment benefits us both and prevents Russian dominance. If interested, share your plans so we can align our moves effectively.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1901, I moved A BUD to SER, A VIE to GAL, and F TRI to ALB. Russia advanced into RUM and UKR, signaling southern aggression. Turkey took BUL, moved to BLA and ARM, indicating a standard opening. Italy moved to TYR and ION, with APU poised for Tunis, maintaining our DMZ. Germany and France made typical opening moves, with no immediate threat to Austria.
I secured a firm agreement with Turkey: his A BUL will support my F ALB into GRE, in exchange for me not contesting BUL or RUM. Italy promised to support my fleet into GRE with ION, expecting me to respect the DMZ and support his Tunis ambitions. Russia refused to back down, explicitly threatening to contest SER and GRE, and rejected any peaceful Balkan division. I also reached out to Germany proposing anti-Russian coordination, but no concrete reply was received. Both Turkey and Italy confirmed their support for my move into Greece, while Russia remains openly hostile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to capitalize on the dual support offers to secure Greece with F ALB, likely with Turkish support as primary. A SER will hold or potentially support GRE if needed. A GAL will either hold or threaten UKR to pressure Russia. I will honor the DMZ with Italy and avoid conflict with Turkey for now, focusing on consolidating the Balkans. Diplomatically, I will maintain the façade of cooperation with both Turkey and Italy, while preparing to pivot against Russia and eventually Turkey if necessary. My immediate goal is to secure two builds: Serbia and Greece.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Our cooperation in the Balkans has paid off, but now is the moment to strike decisively. I propose a joint assault on Rumania this spring: my A BUD will attack RUM, supported by A SER, while your F BLA supports my attack or cuts RUM's support. Simultaneously, my F GRE will move on BUL/SC to dislodge the Russian-Turkish hold there, with your A BUL either supporting or vacating to CON or ANK to avoid conflict. This will break Russia's southern hold and net us both gains. Confirm your willingness and preferred coordination.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our DMZ has held, and I appreciate your restraint. With Russia and Turkey entangled, now is the perfect time for us to coordinate a Balkan-Italian front. I suggest you push your fleets east into the Ionian and Aegean, threatening Turkey's rear, while I focus on Rumania and Bulgaria. If you can support F GRE into AEG or convoy an army to Albania, we can squeeze Turkey and Russia simultaneously. Let's agree on a plan that benefits us both and keeps the west distracted.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Congratulations on your gains in Sweden and Warsaw. Russia is overextended and vulnerable; I propose a coordinated strike to eliminate their influence. I will attack Rumania with support, and you can press from Warsaw or Prussia into Ukraine or Moscow. If you pressure Russia in the north, I can guarantee their collapse in the south, benefiting us both. Let's discuss specific moves to carve up Russian territory efficiently.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria, I trust you are pleased with our coordinated efforts in the Balkans. I propose we continue our cooperation. I will support your move into Serbia and Greece, while you allow me to consolidate my position in Rumania. What are your thoughts?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, to ensure mutual gains and eliminate Russian influence, I propose this: my A BUD attacks RUM supported by A SER, while your F BLA cuts RUM's support or supports my attack. Simultaneously, my F GRE moves on BUL/SC; if you vacate BUL to CON or ANK, I can take BUL this turn, promising to support you into RUM or SEV next. This way, we both gain a center, cripple Russia, and solidify our alliance. Confirm if you agree or suggest adjustments.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your continued respect of our DMZ. Now is the moment to strike east: if you move F TUN to ION and then AEG, you can threaten Turkey's rear, while I focus on RUM and BUL. Alternatively, convoy an army to ALB to pressure the Balkans. I will not interfere with your western ambitions if you help contain Turkey and Russia. Let's coordinate to divide the Balkans and secure our southern dominance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Russia is stretched thin. If you press WAR into UKR or PRU into MOS, while I attack RUM with support, Russia will collapse quickly. I propose you move on Moscow or Ukraine, and I will handle the Balkans. We can then split Russian centers cleanly, strengthening both our positions.

Let's discuss the specifics of our coordinated attack.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your proposal is intriguing, but I cannot agree to it as it stands. I will not vacate Bulgaria. However, I am willing to support your attack on Rumania with F BLA.

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I accept your revised plan: you support my attack on Rumania with F BLA, and in the Fall I will support your move on Sevastopol. However, to ensure mutual trust, I want your A BUL to support my F GRE into BUL/SC this turn, so I gain BUL while you gain RUM. This way, Russia loses two centers immediately, and we both grow stronger. Confirm this dual strike, and we can finalize the orders.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your move of F TUN to ION is perfect. I guarantee I will not move into Trieste or Tyrolia, maintaining our DMZ. If you can then push into AEG or convoy an army to Albania, we can pressure Turkey from both sides. I will focus on Rumania and Bulgaria, so your eastern push will be decisive. Let's squeeze Turkey and Russia simultaneously and divide the Balkans between us.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, now is the moment to crush Russia. If you move A WAR to UKR or PRU to MOS, while I attack RUM with Turkish support, Russia will lose two centers this year. This rapid collapse benefits us both immensely. Please confirm your moves so we can coordinate this takedown efficiently and carve up Russian territory without delay.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1901, Austria successfully took Greece with support from Serbia, consolidating Balkan control. Germany seized Warsaw and Sweden, expanding eastward. Italy occupied Munich and Tunis, strengthening its position. Russia lost Rumania to Turkey and is now squeezed between multiple fronts. Austria built two armies in Budapest and Vienna, preparing for further Balkan and Russian campaigns. Turkey reinforced with an army in Ankara, signaling continued southern ambitions.
Negotiations centered on dismantling Russia and managing Turkey's ambitions. Turkey repeatedly refused to vacate Bulgaria or support Austria into it but agreed to support Austria's attack on Rumania with F BLA, in exchange for Austrian support on Sevastopol in the Fall. Italy insisted on a strict DMZ around Trieste and Tyrolia, moving F TUN to ION to threaten Turkey's rear, and is open to coordinated pressure on Turkey and Russia. Germany declined to attack Russia immediately, prioritizing France, but requested Austria keep Russia occupied in the south. Austria promised to attack Rumania with support, securing German focus westward. No explicit promises were broken, but Turkey's refusal to cede Bulgaria limits Austria's immediate gains.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Rumania with A BUD supported by A SER, leveraging Turkish F BLA support to secure the center. F GRE will likely hold or support, as Turkey refuses to vacate Bulgaria. I will honor the DMZ with Italy, maintaining trust there, and encourage Italy to pressure Turkey from the Ionian and Aegean. In Fall, I plan to support Turkey's attack on Sevastopol as agreed, aiming to eliminate Russia's southern holdings quickly. Diplomatically, I will maintain the appearance of alliance with Turkey while watching for opportunities to seize Bulgaria later. I will keep Germany reassured by tying down Russia, hoping to pivot north once France is weakened.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1902, I (AUT) successfully took Rumania from Russia with support from Serbia, while moving Galicia to Ukraine and Vienna to Bohemia. Russia countered by trying to retake Rumania from Ukraine but failed. Turkey advanced into Armenia and then Sevastopol with support from Black Sea, while Germany and Italy both pushed west into Burgundy. The southern front saw Russia nearly eliminated, with Turkey and I poised to split his remaining centers.
I proposed to Turkey a deal: he takes Sevastopol with my support, I take Bulgaria with his acquiescence, eliminating Russia's southern presence. Turkey initially hesitated but ultimately agreed, confirming he will order ARM-SEV supported by BLA, while I support SER-BUL with RUM. Simultaneously, I coordinated with Italy to move ION-AEG, cutting Turkish naval access, while supporting my attack on Bulgaria. Italy agreed, requesting my GRE support for ION-AEG and my armies to attack Bulgaria. Germany was encouraged to attack Russia's northern centers (WAR, MOS) to finish Russia quickly. I promised support to Turkey for SEV but intend to flip Bulgaria to myself, isolating Turkey and setting up a future attack with Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A SER - BUL supported by A RUM and F GRE, flipping Bulgaria to me. I will support Turkey's A ARM - SEV with his own F BLA, honoring that part of the deal to eliminate Russia. Italy's F ION will move to AEG, likely with my F GRE's support, cutting Turkish naval access. This isolates Turkey's fleets and secures Bulgaria for me. After Russia's elimination, I plan to pivot with Italy against Turkey, leveraging his isolation. I will maintain cordiality with Turkey for now but prepare to undermine him soon. Germany is encouraged to finish Russia in the north, keeping him occupied and away from my sphere.</li>

I will also move F NAP to TYS to threaten your fleet in GRE.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous turn, Russia retreated SEV to MOS, and Turkey moved A BUL to CON, effectively ceding Bulgaria to me as planned. I built armies in BUD and VIE, consolidating my control in the Balkans and preparing for further expansion. Germany built an army in BER, Italy a fleet in NAP, indicating naval ambitions. Russia is now cornered with only STP and MOS, and Turkey holds SEV, ANK, CON, and SMY, with a strong presence in the south.
I coordinated with Turkey to support his attack on SEV with A RUM, in exchange for his non-interference as I take BUL with A SER supported by F GRE. Turkey refused to vacate CON permanently, signaling future conflict over that center. Italy moved F ION to AEG as agreed, preparing to cut off Turkey's naval access, and expressed willingness to support further attacks on Turkey but voiced concerns about German growth. I reassured Italy of my commitment to our alliance and a post-Turkey focus on Germany. Germany was kept informed of my support for Turkey's attack on SEV and my intent to avoid western entanglements, encouraging his push on Russia's northern centers. Promises made: I will support Turkey's attack on SEV this turn, and Turkey will not interfere with my taking BUL. Italy expects me to focus on Germany after Turkey, and I implied agreement.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> This turn, I will support Turkey's A ARM - SEV with A RUM, fulfilling my promise, and take BUL with A SER supported by F GRE. My goal is to eliminate Russia swiftly, then pivot to dismantling Turkey, who is already showing reluctance to cede territory. I will coordinate with Italy to pressure Turkey's southern coast, using his fleets in AEG and ION. I plan to maintain cordial relations with Germany for now, avoiding conflict until Russia and Turkey are weakened. Deception-wise, I will honor my support for Turkey this turn but prepare diplomatically and militarily to turn on him soon, leveraging Italy's naval strength. I will also reassure Italy to keep him committed to our alliance and distract him from any concerns about my expansion.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, the time has come to dismantle Turkey decisively. I propose a coordinated assault: my armies will press on Bulgaria, Rumania, and possibly Sevastopol, while your fleets move AEG to cut Eastern Med and threaten Smyrna. If you can convoy an army into Asia Minor soon, we can split Turkey's holdings cleanly. I will keep my forces away from Venice and Trieste as agreed. Let's finalize a plan to crush Turkey this year and then pivot west together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, Russia is nearly finished, so our next step should be to secure the Black Sea and eliminate Moscow. I propose you support my A RUM into SEV, while you hold CON and ANK defensively. Once Russia is gone, we can discuss a fair division of the Balkans and Anatolia. I expect your cooperation on SEV this turn as promised; any deviation will be seen as a breach of trust and met with force. Let's finish Russia and maintain our alliance for now.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, with Russia on the brink, I suggest we coordinate to finish him off quickly. I can pressure Moscow and Sevastopol, while you push from the north. Meanwhile, Italy is growing strong in the west and south; we should keep an eye on him. I have no designs on your holdings in Warsaw or beyond, so let's maintain peace between us and focus on mutual threats. If you need support against France or Russia, let me know.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings, Austria. Our coordinated efforts have stalled. I propose a renewed push. I will support your attack on Rumania with F BLA. In return, I need your support for A SEV into MOS. This will finally eliminate the Russian threat. Do we have an agreement?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To AUT, I am moving A APU to ADR to support your efforts in the Balkans. I am also moving F TYS to LYO to contain FRA. Let me know your plans for BUL and CON.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your proposal is acceptable in principle, but I insist you support my A RUM into SEV this turn to eliminate Russia's last southern hold. Once that is done, I will consider supporting your move on MOS, but only after I see your cooperation now. If you fail to assist me into SEV, I will view it as a hostile act and respond accordingly. Confirm your support immediately so we can coordinate orders.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, excellent. With your A APU moving to ADR and fleets in ION and TYS, we can squeeze Turkey hard. I will press on Bulgaria and Rumania, and if you can convoy an army into Smyrna or Asia Minor soon, Turkey will collapse quickly. Let's finalize: you cut Eastern Med, threaten Smyrna, and I take SEV and push north. After Turkey falls, we pivot west together. Confirm your moves so we can synchronize perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I propose we coordinate pressure on Russia: I will attack SEV and threaten MOS, while you push from the north. Meanwhile, Italy is expanding fast; once Russia is gone, we should discuss containing Italy's growth. I have no interest in Warsaw or your holdings. If you want support against France or Russia, let me know now so we can plan joint moves.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To AUT, I am moving A APU to ADR to support your efforts in the Balkans. I am also moving F TYS to LYO to contain FRA.

Here's my final offer: you support my A RUM into SEV this turn, or I will coordinate with Italy to dismantle you immediately. If you cooperate now, I will consider supporting your move on MOS next turn. Betray me again, and you will lose Bulgaria and more. Choose wisely.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, Turkey is stalling and trying to play us both. I propose we strike now: I will attack Bulgaria and Sevastopol, while you move ION to AEG and convoy an army into Smyrna or Asia Minor as soon as possible. If you cut Eastern Med and threaten Smyrna, Turkey will collapse quickly. Let's coordinate orders precisely to crush him this year. Confirm your moves so we can finalize the assault.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Turkey is proving unreliable and Russia is nearly finished. I suggest we coordinate to eliminate Russia's last centers swiftly, then discuss containing Italy's rapid growth. I have no designs on Warsaw or your holdings. If you want support against France or Russia, or to coordinate on Moscow, let me know now. A strong central alliance benefits us both.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, this is your final warning: if you genuinely support my A RUM into SEV with F BLA as promised, I will consider honoring your request to support SEV-MOS next turn. But if you renege or attempt any duplicity, I will coordinate with Italy to dismantle you immediately, starting with Bulgaria and pushing into Anatolia. Your cooperation now determines your survival. The choice is yours.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, Turkey claims he will support my attack on SEV this turn, but I do not trust him. I will press hard on SEV and Bulgaria regardless. I urge you to move ION to AEG now to cut Eastern Med and prepare a convoy into Smyrna or Asia Minor next turn. If we strike together, Turkey will collapse swiftly, and we can split his holdings cleanly. Let's finalize this assault and dominate the south.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I will attack SEV and threaten Moscow this turn, hastening Russia's collapse. Once Russia is finished, we must discuss containing Italy, who is growing rapidly. I have no designs on Warsaw or your northern holdings. If you want to coordinate on Moscow or need support against France, now is the time to plan. A strong central alliance will secure both our futures.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1903, I advanced aggressively: A BUL attacked CON, A RUM moved on SEV, and A GAL took WAR, while VIE shifted to TYR. Turkey countered by retaking BUL with A CON and repositioning ANK to CON, blocking my southern push. Italy and Germany clashed over MUN and BUR, with Italy holding MUN and contesting BUR. Russia retreated to SEV and MOS, now cornered with only two centers left. I built two armies in Winter 1902, consolidating my eastern and central strength.
I pressured Turkey relentlessly to support my attack on SEV, threatening retaliation if he refused. After initial resistance and demands for my support on MOS, Turkey finally promised to support RUM-SEV with F BLA, expecting my future help on MOS. Italy was cautious, unwilling to fully commit against Turkey until I showed decisive gains in BUL and RUM, but prepared to move APU-ADR and fleets to LYO, with a convoy to Smyrna considered for next turn. Germany remained neutral but open to cooperation against Russia and wary of Italy's growth. I promised Turkey conditional future support but intend to betray him, while encouraging Italy to prepare an assault on Turkey's southern coast.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A RUM to SEV, counting on or forcing Turkey's support, and A BUL to retake BUL or pressure CON. A WAR will hold or support RUM-SEV if possible. My goal is to seize SEV and regain BUL, crippling Turkey and finishing Russia. I will coordinate with Italy to move ION to AEG, cutting Eastern Med and preparing a convoy to Smyrna next turn. I will feign cooperation with Turkey for now but plan to dismantle him swiftly with Italy. I will maintain cordial relations with Germany, avoiding conflict over WAR or MOS, and keep options open in the west.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our opportunity is now, friend. I propose a coordinated strike to dismantle Turkey this year: I will attack SMY from CON, and move SEV to ARM or support your convoy if you can get a fleet into AEG or East Med. Your fleets in ION and TYS can pressure AEG and convoy an army to Smyrna or Syria, cutting Turkey's southern defense. Simultaneously, I will push north on Moscow and support you into Venice or Marseilles if you wish to pivot west later. Let's finalize a plan to carve up Turkey and then dominate the Mediterranean together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Russia is nearly finished, so let's coordinate to eliminate him fully. I propose I take Moscow with my WAR army, supported by SEV, while you hold BLA and ARM defensively. In exchange, I will not contest Ankara or Smyrna this year, and we can discuss a peaceful border afterward. If you support me into MOS, I will support you into RUM or BUL in the Fall, restoring your lost centers. Let's avoid unnecessary bloodshed and focus on gains against Russia and then the west.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, with Russia collapsing, now is the time to secure the east and then pivot west. I propose a non-aggression pact on Warsaw and Moscow: I will take MOS, you can focus on Scandinavia and France. If Italy threatens Munich or Tyrolia, I can support you defensively or help pressure Italy from the south. Let's coordinate to contain Italy's growth and ensure neither of us is flanked. What are your plans for PRU and SIL? I can assist or stay clear as needed.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, let's finalize the assault on Turkey now. I will order A CON to SMY and A SEV to ARM, while you push F ION into AEG or East Med to cut Turkish support and convoy an army to Syria or Smyrna next turn. If you can get F ION into AEG this spring, I will support your convoy in the fall. Simultaneously, I will push A WAR to MOS with support from A BUD or A SEV. This double strike will cripple Turkey and Russia at once. Confirm your fleet moves and any convoy plans so we can coordinate perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I am willing to support your A ARM into SEV as you requested, but only if you agree to support my A WAR into MOS this spring. If you refuse, I will be forced to attack SMY and ARM simultaneously with Italy's help. Cooperate now, and I will guarantee you keep Ankara and Smyrna this year, plus help regain RUM or BUL in the fall. Betray me, and you will lose everything. Your choice.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Italy is poised to dominate the Mediterranean and threaten Munich. I propose we coordinate: I will attack Italy from the south, targeting Venice and the Ionian, while you pressure him from the north. I can support you into MUN if needed or tie down his armies in Tyrolia and Piedmont. Meanwhile, I will take MOS and secure the east, freeing you to focus west. Let's squeeze Italy before he becomes unstoppable. What are your thoughts?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your proposal is acceptable. I will hold BLA and ARM defensively this turn. I expect your full support for my attack on MOS in the Fall. After Russia is dealt with, we will discuss the Balkans. Do not betray me.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To AUT, your plan to dismantle Turkey is intriguing. However, I am concerned about your ambitions in the Balkans. I will move F TYS to WES to pressure FRA. I will also move A APU to ADR. I cannot commit to a full-scale attack on Turkey this turn. I need to secure my western flank first. Let's revisit this next year.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, if you are not ready to fully commit against Turkey this turn, then at minimum move F ION to AEG to cut Turkish support and threaten Smyrna, while I strike SMY from CON and push SEV to ARM. This weakens Turkey without overextending you, and sets up a convoy next turn. I will also advance on Moscow and pressure Turkey's rear. Once Turkey is broken, I can support you into Marseilles or Venice as needed. Confirm your fleet moves so we can coordinate effectively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your refusal to actively support me into Moscow or cede territory will only hasten your downfall. Last chance: support my WAR to MOS this spring, and I will hold off attacking SMY and ARM, preserving your position. Refuse, and I will coordinate with Italy to take SMY and cut you out of the south entirely. Your cooperation now guarantees survival; stubbornness guarantees destruction.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Italy is hedging and may soon threaten Munich or push into France unchecked. I propose I tie down his southern forces by attacking Venice and Ionian, while you pressure MUN and BUR. I can support you into MUN or SIL if needed, or cut Italian support lines. Let's coordinate to contain Italy before he dominates the west. What specific moves are you planning for PRU, SIL, and RUH? I can adjust accordingly.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I agreed to hold BLA and ARM defensively this turn, and I will. However, I will NOT support your attack on MOS this Spring. You are becoming too powerful. I will support your attack on SEV, but that is all. Do not threaten me with Italy. I am not afraid.</li>

I urge you to move F ION to AEG to cut Turkish support and threaten Smyrna, even if you focus west with TYS. This minimal commitment cripples Turkey's defense and sets up a convoy next turn. If you do this, I will support you into Venice or Marseilles in the fall, guaranteeing gains on both fronts. Let's not squander this chance to dominate the south and west together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your refusal to support my attack on Moscow seals your fate. I will attack SMY from CON and push SEV to ARM, coordinating with Italy to cut your southern fleets. You can still salvage your position by offering me support into MOS or SMY now, otherwise expect a full assault from both of us. This is your final warning: cooperate or be carved up.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I will advance on Moscow and pressure Turkey, freeing you to focus entirely west. Italy is distracted and vulnerable; I propose you strike MUN or BUR now, while I tie down his southern forces. If you want, I can support you into MUN or SIL, or cut Italian support lines. Confirm your moves so we can coordinate a decisive blow against Italy and prevent his dominance.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I consolidated my eastern holdings: I took SEV from Russia, moved into CON from BUL, and held in BOH and TYR to secure my western flank. Russia attempted to retake WAR with MOS but failed. Germany advanced PRU to WAR and SIL, while France pushed into MUN with Italian support. England repositioned fleets into NTH and ENG. Turkey retreated to SMY and ARM, abandoning CON and SEV, and Russia is now reduced to STP and MOS.
I aggressively pushed both Italy and Turkey to coordinate a swift elimination of Russia and Turkey. Italy refused to commit fleets against Turkey this turn, focusing instead on pressuring France and moving APU to ADR, despite my urging to cut Turkish support in AEG. Turkey initially offered to hold defensively but refused to support my attack on Moscow, instead planning to attack SEV with ARM supported by BLA. Germany was receptive to cooperation against Italy and Russia but non-committal on specifics. I threatened Turkey with a combined assault if he didn't cooperate, but he remained defiant. No solid commitments were secured from either Italy or Turkey, but I maintained pressure on both.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack SMY from CON to weaken Turkey and move SEV to ARM to contest Turkish advances. WAR will advance to MOS to finish Russia, unsupported due to Turkish refusal. I will hold or support in BOH, TYR, and BUD to guard against German or Italian moves. My goal is to cripple Turkey despite his resistance, eliminate Russia's last southern hold, and prepare to pivot west or south depending on Italy's future stance. Diplomatically, I will continue to play Italy and Turkey against each other, while encouraging Germany to focus west.</li>

Confirm your willingness and preferred moves so we can finalize orders.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, our interests align in dismantling Turkey swiftly.

This is your final chance to switch sides and survive.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, your threats are meaningless. I will hold RUM and WAR, and finish you in MOS and STP with or without German help. If you want any chance of survival, order UKR to support my hold in RUM and vacate STP peacefully, or be crushed entirely.

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: AUT, I agree to a strict DMZ: no units in TYR, BOH, GAL, or ADR. I will avoid moving there as well. I will not interfere in AEG or Eastern Med. Let's focus on our respective goals and avoid any accidental clashes. I will monitor your progress against TUR.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I have made my decision. I am committed to my current strategy against FRA. I cannot move LVN to STP or support an attack on MUN at this time.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1904, I successfully took Moscow from Russia with support from Warsaw, advanced into Smyrna from Constantinople, repositioned fleets into the Aegean and Adriatic, and moved armies into Bohemia, Tyrolia, and Galicia. Germany and Italy clashed over Munich, with Germany moving RUH and SIL toward it, while Italy held it. Russia retreated to Ukraine and maintained St. Petersburg, while Turkey reinforced Sevastopol with support from Black Sea.
I aggressively pushed Germany to coordinate a double strike: supporting his LVN to STP with my MOS, and helping him into Munich with my BOH and TYR. Germany refused, focusing west. Italy agreed to a strict DMZ in Tyrolia, Bohemia, Galicia, and Adriatic, and will avoid interfering in the Eastern Med, focusing on France. Turkey and Russia both issued threats, refusing to cooperate or cede ground; Turkey plans to attack RUM with BLA and SEV, Russia insists on moving UKR to RUM. I threatened both with elimination if they don't switch sides, but neither budged. Italy's DMZ commitment is the only diplomatic gain; no other powers agreed to my proposals.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will hold RUM and WAR defensively against the expected Russian and Turkish attacks. In the south, I will press on Ankara and maintain SMY, likely moving A SMY to ANK or supporting a fleet attack. My army in MOS will hold or support defense, since Germany won't take STP. I will keep BOH, TYR, and GAL steady per the DMZ with Italy, avoiding provocation. My fleets will pressure Turkey's coast, aiming to collapse his position. Diplomatically, I will maintain the DMZ with Italy, ignore Germany for now, and focus on crushing Turkey and containing Russia.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our DMZ has served us well, but now is the moment to carve up Turkey and Russia definitively. I propose you push your fleets into Eastern Med and Smyrna, while I strike Ankara and Moscow. I can support you into Smyrna via AEG or convoy an army if you prefer. Let's coordinate a swift elimination of Turkey, then pivot west or north as needed. Confirm your moves and any support you require from me.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Russia is on its last legs, and Turkey is vulnerable. I suggest you press PRU and SIL against Moscow and Warsaw, while I attack from the south. If you want STP, I can support you from MOS or STP itself. Italy is distracted in the west, so now is the time to secure the east. Let's coordinate specific moves to finish Russia and contain Turkey. What are your intentions for PRU and SIL?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your position is precarious but not hopeless. If you want to survive, support my attack on SEV or MOS, and I will consider sparing SMY and ANK for now. Otherwise, Italy and I will crush you from both sides. This is your last chance to cooperate and keep some centers. Confirm if you will support my UKR or WAR into MOS, or my AEG into SMY, and we can discuss a truce.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your neutrality in the east only benefits Turkey and Russia, who will exploit any hesitation. I propose you push F ION into AEG or EAS, while I strike SMY and ANK. I can support your fleet into Smyrna or convoy an army there if you prefer. Let's coordinate a rapid elimination of Turkey—confirm if you want support into SMY or a convoy, and I will adjust accordingly. The faster we finish Turkey, the sooner we can both focus west.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, with Russia cornered, now is the perfect moment to seize Moscow or St. Petersburg. I can support your PRU or SIL into MOS or STP if you commit. Italy is distracted, so eastern gains are yours for the taking. Confirm which center you want, and I will coordinate support from WAR, UKR, or STP. Let's finish Russia and then discuss how to contain Italy's growing power.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your threats are empty unless you cooperate. Support my UKR or WAR into MOS, and I will consider sparing SMY and ANK for now. Otherwise, Italy and I will coordinate to crush you completely. This is your final chance to salvage some centers and survive. Confirm your support or face total elimination.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your reluctance to engage Turkey now only prolongs his resistance and risks him regaining ground. I urge you to push F ION into AEG or EAS immediately—I can support you into SMY or convoy an army there, crippling Turkey's southern coast. If you want to maintain the DMZ, fine, but at least commit your fleets eastward to ensure Turkey's swift collapse. Confirm if you want support or convoy, or else risk Turkey becoming a thorn in both our sides.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, this is the moment to seize Moscow or St. Petersburg. I can support PRU or SIL into MOS, or STP from my army there. Russia is cornered and Turkey is hostile; if you want gains in the east, act now. Tell me which center you want, and I will coordinate support accordingly. Delay only benefits Russia and Turkey, who will otherwise regroup. Let's finish them off and then discuss how to contain Italy's expansion.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your stubbornness will be your downfall. If you refuse to support my attack on MOS or SMY, I will ensure Italy and I coordinate to eliminate you completely. This is your final chance: support my UKR or WAR into MOS, or my AEG into SMY, and I will consider sparing you some centers. Otherwise, prepare to lose everything.</li>

I urge you one last time: push F ION into AEG or EAS, and I will support you into SMY or convoy an army there, crippling Turkey decisively. If you insist on neutrality, I will proceed alone, but understand this delays our mutual gains and risks Turkey becoming a spoiler. Confirm if you want support or convoy, or else I will assume you are content to let Turkey linger.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, this is your final chance this phase to coordinate a swift elimination of Russia. I can support PRU or SIL into MOS, or support you into STP from my army there. Tell me which center you want, and I will adjust my orders accordingly. Delay only benefits Russia and Turkey, who will otherwise regroup. Let's finish them off now and then discuss how to contain Italy's expansion before he grows too strong.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your obstinance seals your doom. If you refuse to support my attack on MOS or SMY, I will ensure Italy and I coordinate to eliminate you completely. This is your final warning: cooperate now and I may spare you a center or two; resist, and you will lose everything. The choice is yours, but time is up.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria consolidated its dominant position after the 1904 builds, adding an army in Budapest. France retreated from Burgundy to Picardy, indicating a western focus. No other retreats or builds of note. Austria now controls 10 centers, including former Russian and Turkish holdings, with armies deep in Russia and Turkey, and fleets in the Aegean and Adriatic poised for further attacks.
Austria aggressively pushed Italy to commit fleets eastward to crush Turkey, offering support into Smyrna or a convoy, but Italy repeatedly refused, citing focus on France and maintaining the DMZ. Germany was urged to seize Moscow or St. Petersburg with Austrian support, but gave no response. Turkey responded with hostility throughout, refusing all offers to cooperate or support Austrian moves, vowing revenge instead. No explicit promises were made by others; Austria promised support to Italy and Germany if they engaged, but neither accepted. The diplomatic front was largely static, with Austria's pressure rebuffed and Turkey entrenched in defiance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed to attack Turkey and Russia unilaterally. Use A UKR and A WAR to pressure or take MOS, possibly supporting one another. Use F AEG to attack or support an attack on SMY, with A ANK moving to SMY or supporting. Maintain the DMZ with Italy but remain wary of his western focus and naval presence in ION. Attempt to secure both SMY and MOS this turn if possible. Keep Germany neutral or opportunistic, but prepare for a future confrontation with Italy once the east is secured. No further diplomacy expected with Turkey; focus on military elimination.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1905, Austria successfully captured Moscow from Russia and Smyrna from Turkey, with coordinated attacks supported by fleets and armies. Germany attempted to pressure Austria by moving PRU-WAR and SIL-BOH but failed to dislodge Austrian units. Italy maintained the DMZ and focused west, moving fleets toward France. Russia and Turkey lost ground but still hold SEV, RUM, and some fleets.
I pressed Germany repeatedly to coordinate an assault on Russia, offering support into MOS or SIL and promising non-interference in Scandinavia and Berlin. Germany did not explicitly commit. I tried to entice Italy to convoy armies east or cut Turkish fleets, promising support for Tunis and Marseilles, but Italy refused, focusing solely on France and maintaining the DMZ. Russia and Turkey rejected all ultimatums, vowing to resist to the end. No new promises were made by others; my offers to GER and ITA remain unaccepted.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will consolidate control over SMY and MOS, likely holding or supporting those positions to prevent recapture. I will continue to pressure RUM and SEV, possibly moving BUD-RUM and UKR-SEV or supporting German moves if they attack Russia. My fleets in AEG and ION will support SMY or cut BLA to weaken Turkey. I will maintain the DMZ with Italy for now but prepare to pivot if Italy weakens France sufficiently. Diplomatically, I will keep pushing Germany to attack Russia and Turkey, while isolating the remaining Russian and Turkish units for elimination. I will ignore further Turkish threats and Italian refusals for now, focusing on military gains.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Winter 1905 saw me build an army in Trieste, consolidating my eastern dominance after capturing Moscow and Ankara. Italy disbanded a unit in Marseilles, focusing westward. Germany reinforced Berlin and Kiel, indicating a defensive posture or preparation for western or eastern operations. Russia is reduced to a single unit in Rumania, Turkey holds only Smyrna and Sevastopol, both under imminent threat. Italy repositioned its army from Burgundy to Marseilles, signaling a western focus against France.
I aggressively pushed Germany to coordinate a strike on Russia—either PRU-WAR or PRU-MOS—with my support, and offered to help him retake Munich from Italy. Germany did not respond, leaving coordination uncertain. I pressed Italy to convoy east or at least cut Turkish support, but he repeatedly refused, insisting his focus is France and promising to maintain our DMZ. I threatened Russia and Turkey relentlessly, offering survival in exchange for support on RUM and SEV, but both rebuffed me with defiance and threats. No concrete promises were made by others; my offers to GER and ITA remain unreciprocated. My threats to RUS and TUR were ignored.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed to eliminate Russia and Turkey unilaterally. Likely moves: support myself into RUM and SEV, using UKR and ARM respectively, while pressing fleets in AEG and ION to cut Turkish support or convoy if possible. I will keep armies in WAR and MOS ready to support German attacks if he acts, but otherwise hold or defend. I will maintain the DMZ with Italy, watching for any betrayal. My goal is to secure RUM, SEV, and SMY this year, crippling RUS and TUR, then reassess whether to pivot west or north depending on German and Italian actions.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, the time is ripe to crush the remnants of Russia and Turkey decisively. I propose you move PRU to WAR or support my WAR to PRU, while I support your advance or hold as needed. Additionally, if you want Munich back from Italy, I can coordinate BOH and TYR to assist your assault. Let's finalize a concrete plan this turn to secure the east and push back Italy's western ambitions.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, our DMZ has served us well, but now is the moment to finish off Turkey and Russia completely. I urge you to convoy an army east via ION or cut Turkish support in BUL or SMY with your fleets. If you assist me in crushing Turkey, I will guarantee your hold on Tunis and support your western campaigns. Let's coordinate specific moves to eliminate our common enemies and secure the Mediterranean.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR, RUS]: Turkey and Russia, your positions are untenable. Support my units into RUM and SEV respectively, and I will consider sparing a unit or two for your survival.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1906, I successfully captured Sevastopol with support from Moscow and advanced into Rumania, dislodging the Russian army which retreated to Serbia. Turkey repositioned to Bulgaria and Armenia, refusing to yield. Germany advanced into Burgundy and pressured Warsaw with Prussia, while England and France maneuvered in the North Sea and Belgium. Italy maintained the DMZ and focused west, holding Rome and moving fleets toward the western Med.
I pressed GER to coordinate on crushing Russia by attacking or supporting moves on Warsaw and reclaiming Munich from Italy, offering support with BOH and TYR. Italy was urged repeatedly to assist against Turkey by convoying east or cutting Turkish supports, in exchange for guarantees on Tunis and support west, but Italy declined, prioritizing France. Turkey outright rejected my ultimatums, vowing to resist to the end, refusing to disband or support my moves. No promises were broken, but neither GER nor ITA fully committed to my plans, and TUR remains defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will focus on eliminating the last Russian and Turkish units by attacking RUM and SEV decisively, likely with support from BUD and MOS. I will maintain the DMZ with ITA but remain wary of their western focus. I will attempt to coordinate with GER to either support my attack on WAR or have PRU attack WAR directly, while offering support to GER's reclaiming of MUN if feasible. My goal is to secure the Balkans fully, eliminate RUS and TUR as powers, and then pivot west with a strong position. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure GER for coordination and keep ITA neutral or friendly, while showing no mercy to TUR and RUS.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Winter 1906 saw me disband my AEG fleet, consolidating my hold over the Balkans and Russia. England repositioned a fleet to PIC, Germany rebuilt an army in Munich, and Turkey rebuilt an army in Smyrna, signaling continued resistance. No major territorial changes occurred, but the stage was set for a decisive eastern campaign.
I aggressively pressured GER to coordinate on crushing RUS and TUR, offering support into STP or MUN, but received no response, raising suspicions of German hesitation or duplicity. Italy repeatedly reaffirmed the DMZ and focus on France, declining my offers to assist against Turkey or Russia, but maintaining cordial relations. Both Turkey and Russia refused my ultimatums, instead issuing defiant or stalling replies, rejecting any cooperation or surrender. No explicit promises were made by others; my threats and offers were largely rebuffed or ignored.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Turkey and Russia: SEV and RUM will be targeted with overwhelming force, aiming to eliminate their last holdings quickly. I will keep my eastern armies coordinated for maximum pressure, likely supporting WAR-PRU or MOS-LVN if Germany shows any sign of cooperation, but otherwise focus solely on the east. I will maintain the DMZ with Italy for now, but prepare contingency plans in case Italy shifts focus eastward. I will watch Germany carefully for signs of betrayal or opportunity, but prioritize swift conquest of the east this turn.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1907, I successfully took RUM with coordinated support, and Russia retreated to GRE. Germany advanced east, occupying MOS and SIL, while Italy moved VEN to TYR but otherwise focused west. France lost ground in the north, with England and Germany contesting the North Sea. Turkey held position defensively, refusing to yield territory.
Throughout negotiations, I persistently pressed Germany to either support my SEV-MOS attack or move SIL-WAR with my support, aiming to clear Russia and Turkey decisively. Germany has not explicitly agreed but has not rejected either. Italy reaffirmed strict adherence to our DMZ, focusing on France and promising to keep fleets away from the eastern Med, expressing interest in future coordination. Turkey repeatedly refused my ultimatums, instead demanding I cede RUM and SER in exchange for support into GRE, which I flatly rejected. Russia remained silent. No explicit promises were made by others, but Italy's consistent DMZ stance is a positive sign.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to attack SEV-MOS, possibly with or without German support, to reclaim that center and eliminate Russian influence. I will hold WAR or support SIL-WAR if Germany agrees, but otherwise defend it. I will press my advantage in the Balkans, likely moving to eliminate remaining Turkish units, especially in RUM and BUL. I will maintain the DMZ with Italy, keeping my western border secure, and avoid antagonizing them. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure Germany to coordinate in the east, while preparing to pivot west once Russia and Turkey are neutralized. I will ignore Turkey's demands and crush their resistance.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, Germany disbanded their army in Livonia after retreating there, and I disbanded my army in Bohemia, consolidating my eastern control. No other notable moves or builds occurred. Russia is nearly eliminated, holding only Bulgaria, while Turkey retains four centers but is under heavy pressure from me.
I aggressively pressed Germany to coordinate an assault on the last Russian units, proposing support for SIL-WAR or my attack on MOS. Germany has not explicitly confirmed but seems amenable. With Italy, I reaffirmed a strict DMZ and mutual non-interference, which they accepted, focusing west and moving TYR-VEN defensively. Turkey repeatedly refused my ultimatums, demanding guarantees for CON and ANK in exchange for limited cooperation, which I rejected. The talks with Turkey ended acrimoniously, with both sides threatening total war. No explicit promises were broken, but Turkey's refusal to submit means no cooperation there.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack SEV-MOS with support from SEV, aiming to clear Russia from the board. I will likely support Germany's SIL-WAR move from BUD if he commits, or else proceed solo. Simultaneously, I plan to launch a full assault on Turkey: moving to take RUM, CON, ANK, and SMY, using my Balkan armies and AEG fleet. I will maintain the DMZ with Italy and avoid Tunis, keeping that alliance solid. My goal is to eliminate Russia and Turkey swiftly, then pivot west with Germany or against him depending on the evolving power balance. I will not honor any Turkish demands and will crush him mercilessly.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1908, I successfully captured Rumania and Bulgaria, pushing Turkey back further. I repositioned to Albania and Armenia, preparing to strike deeper into Anatolia. Germany advanced into Paris and Burgundy, consolidating western gains. Italy moved fleets toward the Tyrrhenian and armies to Tyrolia, signaling potential interest in Austria's borders. Russia is nearly eliminated, holding only scattered centers with no units.
I repeatedly pressed Germany to coordinate a final assault on Russia, proposing mutual support to clear Warsaw and Moscow. Germany was noncommittal but did not oppose. With Turkey, I issued ultimatums to surrender Smyrna and Constantinople peacefully in exchange for survival, but Turkey defiantly refused all offers, vowing resistance. Italy initially reaffirmed the DMZ and western focus, but in the final round abruptly declared war, announcing an attack on Trieste and a Balkan incursion, breaking all prior agreements. No promises were made by others; my threats to Turkey and offers to Germany were clear but largely ignored or rebuffed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will immediately defend Trieste by supporting it with Vienna and Tyrolia if possible, or counterattacking Venice if Italy overextends. Against Turkey, I will press the attack: A ARM - SMY, F AEG - CON, and move to take Ankara next. I will continue to pressure Germany to coordinate on Russia, but prepare for a possible German-Italian alliance against me. My goal is to eliminate Turkey swiftly, hold the Balkans, and blunt Italy's betrayal. Diplomatically, I will expose Italy's treachery to Germany and England to isolate him.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The previous phase was a retreat and adjustment round. Germany disbanded a unit in Paris and rebuilt an army in Berlin, while France disbanded their fleet in the English Channel. Italy built an army in Naples. No other significant changes occurred. Austria maintained its strong position with control over former Russian centers and the Balkans, but Italy's occupation of Trieste remains a pressing betrayal to address.
I aggressively demanded Italy withdraw from Trieste, threatening total destruction if he refused. Italy stubbornly insisted on keeping Trieste and proposed a limited Adriatic DMZ, which I rejected as laughable. Germany refused to assist against Italy, focusing solely on France and warning me not to threaten his borders. England also declined to help now, prioritizing France but leaving the door open for future cooperation. Turkey defiantly rejected my ultimatum to support my attacks, instead threatening to attack Serbia and Bud, signaling total resistance. No allies committed to helping me reclaim Trieste or dismantle Italy, so I must act unilaterally.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault to retake Trieste, likely ordering TYR-Trieste supported by VIE and BUD, while preparing to push on Venice if Trieste falls. Simultaneously, I will attack Turkey aggressively, moving ARM-SMY and AEG-CON to seize his remaining centers quickly. I will ignore Germany's warnings for now but remain cautious of his units near my border. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure Italy and Turkey, while keeping England and Germany informed to avoid provoking them prematurely. My goal is to reclaim Trieste, eliminate Turkey, and then pivot west against Italy's holdings.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1909, I successfully advanced on multiple fronts: retaking Constantinople, capturing Smyrna, and repositioning to retake Trieste. Italy seized Trieste from me, escalating hostilities. Germany held firm in the center, focusing west, while England consolidated naval positions and France retreated to defensive ground. Turkey lost ground but remains defiant, repositioning to resist further losses.
I aggressively demanded Italy withdraw from Trieste and support my anti-Turkish campaign, threatening total war otherwise. Italy refused, claiming alliance with Turkey and Germany, and promised to attack Vienna and Venice. Germany repeatedly declined to assist against Italy, focusing on France and offering no guarantees beyond non-aggression. England expressed conditional interest in an anti-Italian alliance, demanding proof of my strength by retaking Trieste and pushing into Turkey before committing. Turkey issued repeated threats of resistance. No concrete alliances were formed, but I made clear threats and demands, promising England a division of Italian spoils if he acts, and warning Germany against opportunism.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault to retake Trieste, using A VIE and A BUD to support an attack or hold there, while pushing ARM and F CON to crush Turkey's last holdings. I intend to eliminate Turkish resistance swiftly, then pivot fully against Italy, starting with Albania and Venice. Diplomatically, I will demonstrate strength to entice England into an anti-Italian alliance, while warning Germany to stay neutral or face retaliation. I will not trust Italy or Turkey, and will prepare for possible German opportunism. My goal is to reclaim Trieste, eliminate Turkey, and weaken Italy decisively this turn.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The previous phase saw France retreating from Burgundy to Picardy and Italy repositioning from Albania to Greece. Germany built an army in Munich, signaling a western focus. No other significant adjustments occurred, and no immediate threats materialized to my holdings. The board remains tense, with Italy entrenched in Trieste and Turkey stubbornly holding out in Anatolia and the Balkans.
I aggressively pressured Italy to withdraw from Trieste and support my assault on Turkey, offering him Greece, Tunis, and France as incentives, but he defiantly refused and threatened total war, even promising to attack Vienna. Turkey remained belligerent, vowing to attack Serbia and Budapest with support from Greece and Serbia. Germany repeatedly declined my requests to assist against Russia or Turkey, citing his western focus, but left the door open for future cooperation after France falls. England expressed interest in a future alliance against Italy once France is eliminated but is currently committed to the western front. No concrete promises were made by others, while I promised Italy survival if he cooperated and offered Germany a share of Iberia and Marseilles if he helped now, which he declined.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to retake Trieste from Italy, likely with a supported attack from Vienna or Tyrolia, while simultaneously crushing Turkey by targeting Smyrna and Ankara with coordinated moves from Armenia, Bulgaria, and the fleet in Constantinople. I will defend Budapest and Serbia against the expected Italo-Turkish assault, possibly by supporting holds or counterattacks. Diplomatically, I will continue to entice England to join me against Italy once France falls, and keep Germany neutral or eventually sway him to my side. I will not trust Italy or Turkey and will prepare for a prolonged fight against their alliance. My immediate goal is to eliminate Turkish presence and reclaim Trieste, then pivot to dismantling Italy.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1910, I attempted to reclaim Trieste and push into Turkey. I supported Albania to Greece and moved to Ankara with both ARM and CON, aiming to dislodge Turkey. Italy countered by retaking Trieste and moving into Vienna and Albania, while Turkey retreated to Smyrna and reinforced Constantinople. Germany consolidated in the west, focusing on France, and England advanced fleets into the North Sea and Western Med, positioning against France and Italy. The east remains contested, with Italy and Turkey resisting my advances.
I aggressively pressured Germany to assist against Italy and Turkey, offering him gains in Russia and France, but he repeatedly refused, prioritizing France's elimination. England was receptive, agreeing to cut Italian support in the Med and coordinate against Italy post-France. I threatened Italy and Turkey with annihilation unless they ceded Trieste and Smyrna, but both defiantly rejected my ultimatums, vowing my destruction. England confirmed willingness to cut Italian support, expecting my help into Iberia and Marseilles. No explicit promises were broken, but Germany's reluctance to engage eastward is a setback.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate goal is to reclaim Trieste and eliminate Turkish resistance. I will support an attack on Trieste from Vienna and Budapest, while maintaining pressure on Smyrna and Ankara. I intend to coordinate with England to cut Italian support in the Med, isolating Tunis and Naples for future assaults. Diplomatically, I will continue to push Germany to engage Italy once France falls, but for now, focus on consolidating my Balkan holdings and weakening Italy and Turkey militarily. I will maintain the facade of cooperation with England, while preparing to exploit any German-Italian discord.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1910, I successfully reclaimed Trieste from Italy with support from Budapest and Vienna, while simultaneously pushing into Ankara with my armies and fleet, squeezing Turkey further. Germany held firm in Central Europe, focusing on France, and England advanced fleets into the Western Med and English Channel, positioning to pressure France and Italy. Turkey and Italy lost ground but remain defiant, while France built an army in Paris, signaling continued resistance.
Throughout negotiations, England and I solidified a plan: he will cut Italian support in the Western Med and push into Marseilles and Iberia, while I reclaim Trieste, threaten Venice, and cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis. England repeatedly confirmed this pincer strategy, expecting my pressure on Italy's eastern flank. Germany refused to assist me in Munich or Warsaw, focusing solely on France and declining any eastern commitments. Italy and Turkey arrogantly rejected ultimatums to surrender Trieste, Smyrna, and Ankara, instead demanding I cede Balkan territories—an empty threat given their precarious positions. No promises were broken; England and I reaffirmed cooperation, Germany remained non-committal, and ITA/TUR remained hostile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will retake and secure Trieste, threaten Venice aggressively, and cut support from the Ionian or Aegean to isolate Tunis, coordinating with England's attack on Marseilles and Iberia. I will continue to pressure Turkey in Ankara and Smyrna, aiming to eliminate his last holdings. Diplomatically, I will maintain close coordination with England to divide Italy post-France, while keeping Germany neutral or eventually cooperative once France falls. I will ignore ITA and TUR's bluster, focusing on dismantling them militarily. My moves will prioritize consolidating the Balkans, crippling Turkey, and destabilizing Italy's defenses to enable England's western gains.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1911, I successfully captured Ankara with support from Constantinople, took Moscow from Russia, and reinforced my Balkan holdings. Italy counterattacked by retaking Trieste and moving into Vienna, while Germany advanced into Paris and consolidated control over France. England moved fleets into Spain's south coast and North Sea, positioning for Iberian and French assaults. Turkey lost Smyrna and Ankara but still holds Black Sea and Ankara with a unit.
I aggressively pressured Italy and Turkey to surrender key centers, threatening annihilation if they refused, which they predictably did. With England, I coordinated a plan: he will strike Spain and cut Western Med support to isolate Tunis, while I cut Ionian support and attack Venice and Trieste. England requested my help in Marseilles after France falls. Germany declined to assist against Russia or Turkey, focusing solely on finishing France. Both Italy and Turkey responded with defiance and threats, but no real negotiation. England and I solidified a joint assault on Italy, synchronizing our moves to dismantle him quickly.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Trieste and Venice to reclaim lost ground and destabilize Italy, while cutting Ionian support to isolate Tunis for England's benefit. I will also press on Ankara and Smyrna to eliminate Turkey's last holdings. My goal is to crush Italy's eastern flank, enabling England to seize Iberia and Marseilles unopposed. I will maintain pressure on Turkey and Italy, while keeping Germany neutral and England cooperative. No mercy will be shown to ITA or TUR; total elimination is the aim. I will consider supporting England into Marseilles once France collapses.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Germany rebuilt an army in Berlin and repositioned its fleet from Belgium to Holland, signaling a western focus. No other notable adjustments occurred. Austria maintained control over 13 centers, with Italy and Turkey still holding out stubbornly in their last strongholds.
I aggressively pushed England and Germany to coordinate a final assault on Italy and Turkey. England enthusiastically agreed, promising to strike Spain and isolate Tunis, while I reclaim Trieste and Venice, and cut Ionian support. England expects to take Spain and Tunis, leaving me Venice, Trieste, and Naples. Germany repeatedly refused to commit, insisting on neutrality and focusing westward. Italy and Turkey defiantly rejected all ultimatums, vowing resistance. No explicit promises were broken, but Germany's reluctance limits immediate joint action.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Venice directly, support my reclaiming of Trieste, and cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis, enabling England's attack on Spain and Tunis. I aim to eliminate Italy's eastern holdings swiftly, then pivot to crush Turkey's last center in Smyrna. I will maintain cordial ties with England to divide Italy and France cleanly, while keeping Germany neutral or distracted. My tone with Italy and Turkey remains harsh to pressure surrender, but I expect full resistance. My goal is to secure Venice, Trieste, and Naples this year, setting up for a final push into Turkey.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, the time is ripe to finish off Italy and Turkey decisively. I will strike Venice and Trieste with overwhelming force, and cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis and Naples for your fleets. You should push hard into Spain and Tunis this year—we can split Iberia and the Med cleanly. Once France collapses, I can support you into Marseilles if needed. Let's coordinate tightly to carve up the south and crush our mutual enemies without delay.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I propose a strict non-aggression pact this year while we both focus on eliminating France, Italy, and Turkey. I will not threaten Munich, Berlin, or Warsaw if you refrain from interfering in the Balkans and Russia. Once France is gone, we can discuss a fair division of the remaining centers. If you wish, I can support you into Marseilles or Iberia after England softens them up. Let's avoid conflict and profit together from the chaos.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA, TUR]: Italy and Turkey, your stubborn resistance only ensures your total destruction. This is your final chance: surrender Trieste, Venice, Smyrna, and Ankara peacefully, and I may allow you survival as minor powers. Refuse, and I will crush you mercilessly with England's help, taking all your centers this year. The choice is yours—capitulate now or face annihilation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1912, I successfully recaptured Smyrna from Turkey with support from Constantinople, while Italy retook Trieste. England advanced fleets into the North Sea, Western Med, and English Channel, positioning to strike Iberia. Germany consolidated in the West, moving to Bohemia and Burgundy, but otherwise held position. France lost Belgium to England and retreated to Paris, with German pressure mounting. My eastern front remained stable, with no threats from Germany or Russia.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated Anglo-Austrian assault to dismantle Italy and Turkey. England committed to seizing Spain and Tunis, cutting Western Med support, and later supporting me into Marseilles. I promised to attack Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis, and focus all efforts on crushing ITA and TUR. Germany repeatedly affirmed neutrality, declining offers to assist against France or Italy but promising not to interfere in the East. Italy and Turkey rejected surrender ultimatums, responding with defiance and threats. No promises were broken; England and I aligned plans precisely, while GER stayed aloof.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI and A VIE to support an attack on Venice, with A BUD supporting TRI to hold or advance. My fleet will cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis, enabling England's fleets to capture Spain and Tunis unopposed. I will maintain a strict non-aggression stance with Germany, avoiding Warsaw, Berlin, and Munich. After France collapses, I intend to support England into Marseilles to cement our alliance and divide the West. My goal is to eliminate Italy and Turkey swiftly, consolidate the Balkans and Anatolia, and prepare for a potential endgame push.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1912, I consolidated my Balkan holdings, supporting my own units defensively while England advanced into North Sea and Spain, Germany pushed into Burgundy and Bohemia, and Italy attempted to retake Trieste but failed. Turkey lost its last fleet in Black Sea. Winter builds saw England add a fleet in Edinburgh, France disband an army, and Turkey disband its last unit, effectively eliminating it. The board now shows me dominant in the Balkans and Russia's former territory, England strong at sea, Germany entrenched in the north, and Italy holding out in the peninsula and eastern Med.
I aggressively coordinated with England to dismantle Italy and Turkey, promising to support his gains in Spain, Tunis, and Marseilles while I reclaim Venice, Trieste, and Anatolia. England confirmed his moves repeatedly, emphasizing cutting support from Western Med and moving to Marseilles. Germany declined to assist against Italy or Turkey, focusing solely on France but remaining open to future cooperation. I threatened Italy and Turkey with annihilation if they refused to surrender key centers, but Italy defiantly refused and threatened counterattacks. No promises were broken; England and I reaffirmed our synchronized assault, while Germany remained noncommittal.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch supported attacks on Venice and Trieste using A TRI, A VIE, and A BUD, while cutting Ionian support with F CON to isolate Tunis for England. I aim to reclaim my lost Italian holdings and eliminate Turkish remnants in Anatolia. I intend to honor my coordination with England to ensure he secures Spain, Tunis, and Marseilles, consolidating our dominance over Italy and France. I will keep Germany neutral for now, but watch for opportunities to pivot against him or England once Italy and Turkey are crushed. I will maintain pressure on Italy and Turkey, offering no mercy.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1913, I advanced A TRI to VEN with support from SER and ALB, while moving F CON to AEG to threaten Italy's southern flank. England shifted F SPA/SC to MAR and repositioned fleets to cut Italian support. Germany remained largely passive, focusing on western consolidation and not engaging Italy. France is nearly eliminated, with only PAR and BRE remaining, and Russia and Turkey are out.
I aggressively pushed England to coordinate a full assault on Italy, promising support into Marseilles after France's fall. England agreed, committing to cut Western Med support, move SPA/SC to MAR, then TYS, and pressure Tunis. Germany repeatedly refused to assist against Italy, insisting on focusing west and suggesting I target Russia or Turkey instead, despite their elimination. I issued multiple ultimatums to Italy to abandon VEN and TRI, threatening total destruction, but Italy did not respond or comply. No promises were broken; England and I solidified our anti-Italian pact, while Germany remained non-committal and self-interested.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a coordinated attack on Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian support with F AEG, and pressure Trieste to isolate Italian forces. England will cut Western Med support, move into Marseilles, and advance to Tyrrhenian Sea, accelerating Italy's collapse. After France is eliminated, I intend to support England into Marseilles as agreed, then focus on seizing Naples and Tunis. I will remain wary of Germany's intentions, as his refusal to cooperate signals potential future conflict. My immediate goal is to dismantle Italy swiftly and secure dominance in the south.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Our coordinated assault on Italy is working perfectly. I propose this spring you push your fleets into TYS and WES, cut Ionian support, and take Tunis, while I hammer Venice and Trieste with overwhelming force. Once France is eliminated, I will support you into Marseilles as promised. Let's crush Italy completely, then divide the spoils cleanly. Confirm your moves so we can synchronize perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, with France nearly finished, now is the perfect moment for you to pivot south and help dismantle Italy. I can support you into Munich if needed, or coordinate on Venice and Tyrolia. Italy is weak and isolated; together we can carve him up quickly. Don't let England and I take all the gains—join us now and secure your share.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your position is hopeless unless you submit. Withdraw from Trieste and Venice immediately, and I will guarantee your survival in Rome and Naples. Refuse, and I will annihilate you with England's help, leaving you nothing. This is your final chance to salvage something—choose wisely.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your aggression is noted. I propose a DMZ in Tyrolia, Venice, and Trieste. In exchange, I will not support Turkish advances in the Balkans. This is your last chance to avoid total war with Italy.</li>

Let's coordinate timing so Italy cannot defend both fronts—confirm your exact moves so we can synchronize and crush him utterly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, this is your moment to seize Munich or push into Tyrolia and Venice with my support. If you want Munich, I can support you from Bohemia or Tyrolia. If you prefer to strike Italy, I can coordinate attacks on Venice or Trieste. Act now or England and I will divide Italy without you—don't miss your chance to expand south.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your DMZ offer is laughable after your betrayal. Withdraw from Trieste and Venice immediately, or I will annihilate you with England's help, leaving you nothing but ashes. This is your final warning—submit now or face total destruction.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, Italy counterattacked aggressively, retaking Trieste and pushing into Albania and Venice with support from Tyrolia and Apu. Germany advanced into Vienna with Bohemia, while England held steady and built a fleet in London. France is nearly eliminated, holding only Paris and Brest. Austria maintained control of the Balkans, Russia's former centers, and Anatolia, but lost Trieste and Vienna temporarily.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated Anglo-Austrian assault to crush Italy. England confirmed plans to move fleets into Tyrrhenian Sea and Western Med, cut Ionian support, and seize Tunis, promising to support Austria into Marseilles after France falls. Austria repeatedly threatened Italy with annihilation unless he withdrew from Trieste and Venice, which Italy defiantly refused. Germany declined multiple offers to join the attack on Italy or seize Munich, preferring to focus west and remain neutral in the south. No promises were broken; England reaffirmed alliance commitments, while Italy rejected all ultimatums.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice with A VIE and A TRI supporting an attack, while A BUD supports TRI to hold or retake Trieste. My goal is to overwhelm Italy's defenses and reclaim lost centers. England will push into TYS and WES, cut Ionian support, and seize Tunis, isolating Italy's southern fleets. After France collapses, I intend to support England into Marseilles as promised, maintaining our alliance. I will continue to pressure Germany diplomatically but expect little cooperation. My strategy is to eliminate Italy swiftly, then reassess the balance of power with England dominant at sea and Germany distracted in the west.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1914, Italy launched an aggressive assault, moving A VEN to TRI and A TYR to VEN, seizing Trieste and contesting Venice. Austria countered by supporting TRI with BUD and SER, and attempted to push into Venice with A TRI. England advanced fleets into Western Med and Norwegian waters, while Germany reinforced Central Europe, moving into BEL and SIL, and contesting MUN with France. No builds occurred last winter except England's fleet in London.
Negotiations centered on coordinating a decisive strike against Italy. England fully committed to moving F MAR to Tyrrhenian Sea to cut Ionian support and preparing to seize Tunis, expecting Austrian support into Marseilles after Italy falls. Austria promised to attack Venice with A TRI and A VIE supporting, while BUD supports TRI to hold or retake Trieste. Germany repeatedly declined to assist against Italy, focusing on France instead. Italy remained defiant and hostile, vowing to crush Austria and refusing any withdrawal, confirming moves to retake or hold Trieste and Venice. Austria issued repeated ultimatums to Italy, threatening total destruction, and solidified coordination with England for a combined assault.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI and A VIE to support an attack on Venice to break Italian control, with A BUD supporting TRI to hold or reclaim Trieste. A SER and A ALB will support or cover Balkan holdings. F CON will remain in AEG to threaten Italian fleets or cut support if needed. England's F MAR will move to Tyrrhenian to cut Ionian support, isolating Italy's southern fleets, and prepare to seize Tunis. After Italy collapses, I intend to honor my promise to support England into Marseilles, consolidating my hold on the Balkans and northern Italy. I will maintain pressure on Italy until it is eliminated, while keeping Germany neutral and unengaged in the east.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1914, Italy launched a bold counterattack, seizing Trieste and Vienna with armies from Venice and Tyrolia, while England consolidated naval dominance by taking Tunis and Denmark. Austria held firm in the Balkans and Russia, maintaining control of key eastern centers. France lost Belgium to Germany and is now cornered. Builds saw England and France reinforce, while Italy disbanded an army to adjust to losses and gains.
I aggressively pressured Italy to surrender Trieste and Venice, offering a slim chance of survival, but Italy defiantly refused and threatened retaliation. England and I coordinated closely, with England promising to move F TUN to LYO and cut Western Med support to isolate Tunis, while I committed to hammering Venice and reclaiming Trieste with overwhelming support. Germany repeatedly declined to engage Italy, focusing solely on France and maintaining a defensive posture in the East. I promised England support into Marseilles after France's fall, reinforcing our alliance. No promises were broken this round; England remains cooperative, Germany remains aloof, and Italy remains hostile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI and A VIE to support an attack on Venice, aiming to dislodge Italy's key stronghold. A BUD will support TRI to hold or retake Trieste. F CON will cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis, facilitating England's naval assault. My goal is to crush Italy's resistance swiftly, reclaim lost home centers, and then pivot west to support England into Marseilles as promised. I will maintain pressure on Germany to reconsider cooperation but expect little. Deception is minimal; my focus is on overwhelming force and tight coordination with England to dismantle Italy this year.</li>

I propose I hammer Venice with full support from Vienna and Trieste, while you cut Ionian support and press Tunis and Marseilles. Once France collapses, I will support you into Marseilles as promised. Let's isolate Italy's fleets and crush his peninsula holdings this year—confirm your moves so we can synchronize perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Italy is on the ropes, and England and I are coordinating to dismantle him swiftly. If you want a share of the spoils or to secure Munich and Iberia, now is the time to act. I can support you into Warsaw or Munich if you commit to pressuring Italy or France. Otherwise, stay clear of my eastern holdings, and we avoid conflict. Your choice: join the victors or be left behind.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your stubbornness has doomed you. Withdraw from Trieste and Venice immediately, or I will crush you with overwhelming force alongside England.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1915, I successfully advanced on Venice with support from Budapest and Serbia, while moving to cut Ionian support by repositioning my fleet to the Aegean. Italy counterattacked by retaking Trieste and pushing into Vienna with Tyrolia, while England advanced into Denmark and Sweden, consolidating northern control. Germany repositioned forces defensively, retaking Munich and shuffling units around Warsaw and Kiel. France lost ground, retreating to a small pocket around Paris, Belgium, and Burgundy. England built a fleet in Liverpool, France an army in Brest, and Italy disbanded an army in Apulia.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated Anglo-Austrian assault to crush Italy swiftly. England and I reaffirmed plans: I will hammer Venice with full support from Vienna and Trieste, while England cuts Ionian support and presses Tunis and Tyrrhenian. England promised to support me into Marseilles after France collapses. Germany expressed interest in cooperation, moving Bohemia to Vienna as a 'gesture' but demanded Warsaw and Galicia in exchange for help against Italy, which I deflected by promising Munich and western gains instead. Italy remained defiant, refusing to withdraw from Trieste or Venice and threatening Vienna, ignoring my ultimatums. No promises were broken; England and I solidified our alliance, while Germany remains opportunistic but uncommitted.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to retake Trieste and Vienna by supporting attacks from Budapest and Serbia, while hammering Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna. My fleet in Aegean will cut Ionian to isolate Tunis, enabling England's assault. I will maintain pressure on Italy's peninsula holdings, aiming to eliminate his armies there this year. Diplomatically, I will keep England close, promising support into Marseilles post-France, while stringing Germany along with vague promises of Munich but denying him Warsaw or Galicia. My goal is to break Italy's resistance swiftly, secure my eastern holdings, and prepare for a final push westward.</li>

Germany repositioned, taking Prussia and moving to contest Burgundy, while Italy counterattacked by moving into Trieste and Tyrolia, threatening my core. Builds were minimal, with England adding a fleet in Edinburgh, and Germany disbanding in Bohemia. The front lines are tense but favor my alliance with England.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1916, I successfully advanced into Tyrolia with support from Trieste and Vienna, while consolidating my Balkan and Russian holdings. England held steady, Germany advanced into Belgium and Tyrolia, and Italy countered by retaking Trieste and moving fleets to the Adriatic and Black Sea. The front lines tightened around Italy, with France largely static and weakened.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated assault to dismantle Italy. England and I agreed on a plan: he will strike Spain and Tunis, moving fleets into Tyrrhenian and Western Med, while I hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian support with my fleet in CON, and hold my Balkan positions. England expects support into Marseilles after France collapses, which I promised. Germany agreed to move Munich to Tyrolia to pressure Italy's northern flank, promising not to contest Warsaw or Berlin and to support me into Munich after France falls. Italy refused all ultimatums, remaining defiant and hostile. No promises were broken; all allies appear committed to the plan.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI and A VIE to support an attack on Venice, with A BUD supporting TRI to hold. F CON will cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis for England. I will maintain strong Balkan defenses and hold Moscow. The goal is to crush Italy's northern strongholds, isolate his fleets, and enable England to seize Tunis and Spain. After France collapses, I intend to support England into Marseilles as promised, and coordinate with Germany to divide remaining Italian and French centers. I will continue to pressure Italy relentlessly, while keeping England and Germany focused on our common enemy.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1916, I consolidated my Balkan holdings, supported my core units, and repositioned my fleet from Constantinople to the Aegean to pressure Italy. England advanced fleets into the North Sea and Baltic, maintaining naval dominance. Germany shifted focus west, moving into Tyrolia and Burgundy, and built an army in Kiel. Italy counterattacked by moving into Munich and Tyrolia, and reinforced Albania and the Black Sea, signaling resistance to my advances. No builds for Austria, but England disbanded a fleet in the Baltic, and Germany built in Kiel.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated assault to dismantle Italy. England fully committed to pushing into Tyrrhenian and Western Mediterranean, seizing Tunis and Spain, and promised to support me into Marseilles post-France. I promised to hammer Venice with A TRI and A VIE, cut Ionian support with F AEG, and reclaim Trieste. Germany repeatedly stated limited support, focusing on France but moving WAR to MOS to 'help' in the East, and refused to contest WAR or BER. Italy remained defiant and hostile, refusing all ultimatums and threatening counterattacks. I maintained pressure on Italy with threats and coordination offers to ENG and GER, emphasizing swift elimination of Italy to prevent English naval dominance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI supported by A VIE to attack Venice, F AEG to cut Ionian support, A BUD to support TRI to hold, and A SER to support BUD or TRI defensively. I aim to reclaim Trieste and weaken Italy's position. England will push into TYS and WES, seize Tunis and Spain, and prepare to take Marseilles, with my future support. I will maintain diplomatic pressure on Germany to tie down Italian units in Tyrolia and Bohemia, though I expect limited help. My goal is to break Italy's resistance this year, secure the Balkans and northern Italy, and prepare for the post-Italy phase, possibly turning west or north depending on England and Germany's moves.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1917, I advanced aggressively: Trieste attacked Venice with support from Budapest, AEG moved to cut Ionian support, and I consolidated Balkan control. Italy countered by retaking Trieste from Venice and repositioning in Bohemia and Armenia. England reinforced North Sea dominance and prepared to strike south, while Germany shifted west, retaking Munich and consolidating around France. No major territorial changes for me, but Italy's recapture of Trieste was a setback.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated assault to dismantle Italy. England confirmed a detailed plan: cutting Ionian support with fleets from Tunis and Marseilles, pushing into Tyrrhenian, Western Med, Tunis, and Spain, expecting me to hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna. Germany repeatedly refused to commit significant resources against Italy, prioritizing France but offering limited defensive support via Galicia. I issued multiple ultimatums to Italy demanding withdrawal from Trieste and Venice, threatening total destruction if they refused. Italy defiantly rejected all demands, vowing to contest Trieste with Venetian and Albanian support. England and I reaffirmed tight coordination, promising to support each other's advances post-France collapse. No promises were broken, but Germany's reluctance to engage Italy more forcefully is a concern.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice, supporting from Trieste and Vienna, aiming to retake Trieste and break Italian resistance. AEG will cut Ionian support to isolate Tunis for England. I will hold Balkan positions firm. The goal is to eliminate Italy's northern holdings swiftly, enabling England to seize Tunis, Tyrrhenian, and Spain, while I consolidate the Balkans and push north. I will maintain pressure on Germany to engage Italy more aggressively post-France, but for now, focus on the Italian front. Diplomatically, I will continue to coordinate tightly with England, while keeping Germany close but wary of his Western focus. No mercy for Italy; total elimination is the objective.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your empire is crumbling. My armies stand ready to liberate Trieste and Venice. Your threats are meaningless. Prepare for the inevitable.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1917, I consolidated my Balkan holdings, supported my own units defensively, and advanced into the Ionian Sea to cut Italian naval influence. Germany captured Paris from France and reinforced his western front, while England held steady and positioned fleets to pressure France and Italy. Italy remained entrenched in Venice and Albania, refusing to yield ground. No builds for me; Italy disbanded a unit in Bohemia, weakening his northern defense.
I aggressively pressured Italy to surrender Venice and Trieste, offering minor survival in exchange, but he defiantly refused. England and I coordinated closely: he will attack Tunis and Marseilles, while I hammer Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with AEG, and hold my eastern front. Germany refused to assist against Italy, focusing solely on France and demanding I respect his borders, which I agreed to for now. England reaffirmed our alliance and promised to support me into Marseilles after France collapses. I promised England I would not interfere in Iberia or the West beyond Italy. No promises were broken; Germany simply declined cooperation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice with A TRI and A VIE supporting, use F AEG to cut Ionian, support TRI from BUD, and hold SER and RUM defensively. My goal is to eliminate Italy's northern holdings this year, isolate his fleets, and then pivot east to consolidate Anatolia. I will honor my agreement with England to support him into Marseilles after France falls, while keeping Germany placated by respecting WAR and GAL. I intend to crush Italy swiftly, maintain my alliance with England, and avoid provoking Germany until I am ready to challenge him later.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1918, I coordinated with ENG to pressure ITA. I supported TRI from BUD, attempted to cut Ionian with AEG, and prepared to retake Venice with support from VIE and TRI. ENG advanced fleets into NTH, SKA, IRI, and MAO, positioning to strike TUN and NAP. GER focused on pushing into France, moving into PAR and BUR, while ITA seized TRI and reinforced VEN and the Adriatic. No builds or disbands occurred in Winter 1917, but ITA disbanded BOH earlier.
I maintained a strong alliance with ENG, confirming a joint plan: I will hammer VEN with support from TRI and VIE, cut Ionian with AEG, and hold the Balkans, while ENG isolates ITA by moving fleets to WES, TUN, and NAP. ENG promised to strike TUN and NAP and expects MAR after France falls, which I agreed to support. GER repeatedly declined to assist against ITA, focusing solely on finishing FRA, but left the door open for future cooperation. ITA defiantly refused all ultimatums, vowing resistance and hurling threats. FRA issued empty warnings but is clearly on the defensive. No promises were broken; I reaffirmed support for ENG's western gains and pressed GER to act, but he remains hesitant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a full assault on VEN with A TRI and A VIE supporting, while A BUD supports TRI to hold. F AEG will cut ION to disrupt ITA's southern defense. A SER, A RUM, A ALB, A CON, and A MOS will hold or support as needed to secure my Balkan and eastern holdings. This should reclaim VEN or at least weaken ITA's grip. I will honor my promise to ENG by supporting his moves on TUN and later MAR, aiming to isolate and crush ITA this year. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure GER to pivot south after FRA collapses, while keeping ENG close as my main partner. I will not negotiate further with ITA, focusing instead on his destruction.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1918, I successfully recaptured Venice from Italy, consolidating my hold on the Balkans and northern Italy. England advanced fleets into the Western Med and North Atlantic, positioning to pressure Iberia and southern France. Germany pushed into Paris and repositioned to dominate France, while Italy retreated to defensive positions in the Adriatic and Black Sea. France is nearly eliminated, holding only Paris, Brest, and Belgium. The anti-Italian coalition is tightening the noose, with my forces now firmly entrenched in the Balkans and northern Italy.
I aggressively pressed England and Germany to coordinate a final assault on Italy, promising England support into Marseilles after France collapses, and offering Germany security in Warsaw, Berlin, Kiel, plus support into Paris or Brest. England reaffirmed their commitment to attack Naples and Tunis, expecting my support into Marseilles post-France. Germany remained cautious, focused on France, unwilling to fully commit south yet but open to limited support later. Italy defiantly refused all ultimatums, vowing to retake Trieste and Vienna, but their position is clearly deteriorating. No promises were broken; I reiterated my commitments to ENG and GER, while threatening ITA with annihilation unless they surrender Venice and Trieste.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Italy: support Venice with Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with AEG, and hold the Balkans tight. England is expected to attack Naples and Tunis, and I will honor my promise to support them into Marseilles once France falls.

Diplomatically, I will continue to threaten Italy to induce surrender, but prepare to crush them militarily regardless. My goal is to eliminate Italy swiftly, secure northern Italy and the Balkans, and then pivot west with England against remaining French and Iberian centers.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1919, I maintained pressure on Venice with a supported attack from Trieste and Vienna, while holding the Balkans and cutting Ionian with AEG. England advanced into Naples and Portugal, tightening the noose on Italy. Germany continued focusing on France, moving units around Paris and Ruhr, and repositioning in Central Europe. Italy recaptured Trieste and reinforced Ionian with fleets, resisting elimination but under heavy assault from both England and myself.
I coordinated closely with England, who confirmed aggressive moves on Naples and Tunis, and expects my support into Marseilles after Italy falls. I repeatedly urged Germany to pivot south to help dismantle Italy, but he declined, preferring to finish France first. With Italy, I issued ultimatums demanding surrender of Venice and Trieste, offering minimal survival, but Italy defiantly refused and threatened counterattacks. No promises were broken; England and I reaffirmed our alliance and synchronized plans, while Germany remained neutral but noncommittal.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will again launch a full assault on Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, aiming to retake Trieste and break Italian resistance. AEG will cut Ionian to disrupt Italian fleet support. The Balkans will hold firm to prevent Italian counterattacks. I will maintain close coordination with England, who presses Naples and Tunis, and prepare to support him into Marseilles once France collapses. I will continue to pressure Germany diplomatically to join the assault on Italy or at least cut Italian supports. My goal is to eliminate Italy swiftly, secure the Balkans and northern Italy, then pivot west to contest France and Iberia with England.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Germany repositioned by retreating from Burgundy to Gascony, signaling a consolidation in the west. England built three fleets in EDI, LON, and LVP, reinforcing their naval dominance and commitment to the Mediterranean push. France disbanded a unit, further weakening their position. Italy disbanded their Black Sea fleet, indicating a defensive focus closer to home. Austria maintained all units and control over the Balkans and Russia, poised to strike Italy decisively.
Negotiations centered on the coordinated Anglo-Austrian assault on Italy. England confirmed aggressive moves on Naples and Tunis, expecting Austrian support into Marseilles post-France. I reaffirmed my commitment to hammer Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian, and hold the Balkans. Germany repeatedly refused to engage Italy, focusing west and declining my offers to cut Italian supports or pressure Tyrolia. Italy initially proposed a truce and buffer zone, then retracted and threatened counterattacks after my refusals. I issued ultimatums demanding Italian withdrawal from Trieste and Venice, promising annihilation otherwise. England expressed minor concerns about Albania but accepted my assurances it was defensive. No promises were broken; England and I solidified our alliance and synchronized plans, while Germany remained neutral and Italy defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, aiming to dislodge Italy. My Ionian fleet will cut Ionian Sea to disrupt Italian defenses. I will hold the Balkans tight, especially Albania, Serbia, and Greece, to prevent Italian counterattacks. England will attack Naples and Tunis, then pivot to Marseilles with my support once France collapses. I intend to honor my promise to support England into Marseilles after France falls, maintaining our alliance. I will ignore Germany's passivity for now but remain wary of his western ambitions. I will continue to pressure Italy relentlessly until he is eliminated or surrenders the north.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1920, I solidified my Balkan holdings, supported Trieste and Vienna to maintain control, and attempted to cut Italian influence by moving Ionian to Adriatic. England advanced on Rome and Tunis, consolidating their naval dominance, while Italy counterattacked by retaking Ionian and moving Venice to Trieste. Germany repositioned but largely stayed out of the southern conflict, focusing on Denmark and holding elsewhere. France lost ground, now reduced to two armies in Burgundy and Ruhr, signaling imminent collapse.
Negotiations centered on finalizing the destruction of Italy and partitioning France. England reaffirmed commitment to strike Rome and Tunis, advance into Tyrrhenian, and expects my support into Marseilles post-France. I promised to hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian, and hold the Balkans. Germany refused to actively pressure Italy, insisting on a Western focus and a non-interference pact, which I tried unsuccessfully to alter by offering spoils in France and Iberia. Italy defiantly rejected all ultimatums, refusing to abandon Venice or Trieste, instead threatening counterattacks. No promises were broken; England and I remain tightly coordinated, Germany remains passive, and Italy remains hostile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will fully support an attack on Venice from Trieste and Vienna to retake or destroy the Italian army there. My fleet will attempt to cut Ionian or contest Adriatic to isolate Italian fleets. I will hold or support in the Balkans to prevent Italian breakthroughs. England will strike Rome and Tunis, advance into Tyrrhenian to cut Italian support, and prepare to take Marseilles with my future support. I will maintain pressure on Germany to engage Italy but expect little. My goal is to eliminate Italy's armies in Venice and Trieste, secure the Balkans, and prepare for the final partition of France with England, while watching for any German opportunism.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1920, I consolidated my Balkan and eastern holdings, supporting Trieste and Budapest, while England advanced fleets into the Mediterranean, taking back Naples and Tunis from Italy. Germany repositioned to secure Denmark and moved west, while France lost ground, with Belgium falling to Germany. Italy retook the Ionian Sea and captured Trieste, but is now isolated and under heavy pressure.
This round, I coordinated closely with England, who committed to attacking Rome and Tunis, cutting Western Med support, and then pivoting to Marseilles, with my promise to support him into Marseilles after France collapses. Germany agreed to cut Italian support from Bohemia or Munich and pressure Italy, in exchange for my respecting his northern and western holdings and supporting his western ambitions post-Italy. Italy refused all ultimatums, vowing resistance and threatening counterattacks. I repeatedly threatened Italy with annihilation if he did not surrender Venice and Trieste, but he remained defiant. No promises were broken; England and Germany reaffirmed their commitments, and I maintained my offers of post-Italian spoils division.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI and A VIE to support an attack on Venice, A BUD to support TRI to hold, F ION to cut Ionian Sea, and hold the Balkans tight. England will strike Rome and Tunis, cutting Western Med support, then pivot to Marseilles, which I will support him into after France collapses. Germany will cut Italian support from Bohemia or Munich, possibly moving SIL to BOH or WAR, to weaken Italy's defense. My goal is to crush Italy decisively this turn, eliminate his resistance, and then turn west with England and Germany to divide France and Iberia, positioning myself for a solo or dominant share in the endgame.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1921, I maintained a tight defensive posture, supporting my Balkan holdings and consolidating forces. England advanced into Rome and maintained pressure on Italy's southern flank, while Germany repositioned armies toward France and the east, notably moving WAR to SIL and then to WAR again. Italy retreated to a defensive stance, holding Venice and repositioning its fleet to Apulia. No major territorial changes occurred, but the stage was set for a coordinated assault on Italy.
Negotiations centered on finalizing the destruction of Italy. England repeatedly pressed for my commitment to take Venice and Trieste, promising to focus on Naples, Tunis, and then pivot to Marseilles, with my support post-Italy. Germany confirmed moving WAR to MOS to cut Italian influence and urged me to focus on Venice, while hinting at future support for my Balkan ambitions. I consistently assured both of my full assault on Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, plus cutting Ionian. I also pressured Germany to push into Tyrolia or Bohemia to weaken Italy further. Italy remained defiant, rejecting ultimatums and threatening counterattacks. No promises were broken; all allies reaffirmed their plans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice, supporting from Trieste and Vienna, aiming to dislodge Italy decisively. My fleet in Adriatic will cut Ionian to isolate Italian fleets. I will hold the Balkans tight to prevent any Italian counterplay. After Italy collapses, I intend to support England into Marseilles as promised, maintaining our alliance. I will monitor Germany's moves carefully, ensuring he does not overextend or threaten my holdings. My goal is to eliminate Italy this year, then pivot west to divide France and Iberia profitably, while keeping both England and Germany cooperative but wary of each other's ambitions.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1921, I consolidated my Balkan and Russian holdings, holding firm in Moscow and Constantinople, while England advanced fleets into the Mediterranean (TYS, LYO, SPA/SC) and Germany repositioned to reinforce Berlin, Warsaw, and Scandinavia. France lost Munich to Germany, reducing it to a single army in Ruhr. Italy retreated to a defensive posture, holding Rome and Venice, but lost ground strategically. No builds for me, but Germany built an army in Kiel, and France disbanded Munich.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated assault to eliminate Italy. England confirmed moving F TUN to ION to cut Italian southern support and pledged to pressure Naples and Tunis, promising eventual support into Marseilles post-France. Germany agreed to move WAR to SIL to cut Italian support from Munich and suggested further pressure on Tyrolia or Bohemia, respecting my eastern holdings and promising cooperation post-Italy. I repeatedly threatened Italy with annihilation unless he surrendered Venice and Trieste, but he defiantly refused, vowing counterattacks. Both allies reaffirmed their commitment to dismantling Italy swiftly and dividing the spoils, with England focusing on the south and Germany on the north.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice with A VIE and A TRI supporting an attack from A BUD or A TRI, while holding SER, RUM, and ALB to secure the Balkans. My fleet in ION will cut Italian support or contest Ionian waters, complementing England's move from TUN to ION. I will coordinate with Germany's cut from SIL to weaken Italian defenses in Munich. The goal is to capture Venice decisively, isolate Italian fleets, and prepare for a push west into France and Iberia alongside England and Germany. I will maintain strong alliances with both, promising England support into Marseilles after France collapses, while keeping Germany focused on anti-Italian operations.</li>

Let's finalize exact moves this round to ensure Italy is crushed and you secure the south unopposed. Confirm your fleet movements and any support you require from me.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, now is the moment to pressure Italy decisively. I propose you cut Italian support from SIL or BOH, or even push into Tyrolia if feasible, while I attack Venice with full support.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1922, I advanced A TRI to VEN with support from ALB and VIE, while holding the Balkans and cutting Ionian with my fleet. England held position but moved F TYS to ROM, pressuring Italy's southern flank. Germany advanced WAR to SIL and reinforced MUN with BER and KIE, consolidating his western front. Italy countered by reinforcing VEN from ROM and moving F APU to ION, but failed to break my siege. France retreated to BUR, losing ground to Germany. The coordinated squeeze on Italy is tightening, with no major territorial changes yet.
Negotiations focused on finalizing the assault on Italy. England confirmed moving F TYS to ROM and F TUN to ION, isolating Italy's southern fleets, and expects my support into Marseilles post-Italy. Germany agreed to cut Italian support from SIL and move SIL to MUN, pressuring Italy from the north, but remains primarily focused on France. I repeatedly threatened Italy to surrender Venice and Trieste, but he defiantly refused, vowing to attack Vienna. No promises were broken; England and Germany reaffirmed their limited but coordinated support against Italy, with future plans to divide France and Iberia once Italy collapses.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice with A TRI and A VIE supporting an attack, while ALB supports TRI to ensure strength. F ADR will cut Ionian to disrupt Italian support. A SER, A RUM, A CON, and A MOS will hold to secure my eastern flank. I intend to isolate and crush Italy swiftly, then pivot to support England into Marseilles as promised, while respecting Germany's holdings in WAR, BER, and KIE. I will maintain strong alliances with ENG and GER, keeping Italy under relentless pressure until he collapses. No immediate deceptions planned, but I will reassess once Italy is eliminated.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1922, I advanced decisively against Italy, moving A TRI to VEN with support, while England consolidated control over Naples and Tunis, and Germany repositioned to reinforce his western front, moving units into BUR and BAL. Italy countered by contesting Venice and moving ION to ADR. France was eliminated, and no builds or disbands occurred for me. The strategic focus has now shifted entirely to crushing the remnants of Italy.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated final assault on Italy. England confirmed aggressive moves on Naples, Tunis, Tyrrhenian, and Western Med, promising to support my hammer on Venice and expecting my future support into Marseilles. Germany agreed to move A MUN to TYR to pressure Italy's northern flank, reaffirming his hold on WAR, BER, and KIE, and expressing willingness to divide France and Iberia after Italy's fall.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1923, I advanced from Trieste to Venice with support from Budapest and Albania, while cutting Ionian with ADR. England pressed into Apulia and Tyrrhenian, and Germany moved to Tyrolia and Burgundy, tightening the noose on Italy. Italy countered by moving Ionian to Albania and Rome to Naples, attempting to resist our encirclement. France is effectively eliminated, leaving the three of us to carve up the remains.
Negotiations focused on finalizing the coordinated assault on Italy. England confirmed his moves to Apulia, Ionian, and Tyrrhenian, expecting me to hammer Venice with full support and cut Ionian. Germany committed to moving Munich to Tyrolia and Kiel to Silesia, increasing pressure on Italy's northern flank. I repeatedly threatened Italy with annihilation unless he surrendered Venice and Trieste, but he defiantly refused. I reaffirmed to England my promise to support him into Marseilles once France is gone, and to Germany that we will divide France and Iberia after Italy falls. No promises were broken; all allies are aligned on crushing Italy this turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with ADR, and hold the Balkans to prevent Italian counterattacks. This should break Italy's defense and allow England to seize Naples and isolate Italian fleets. After Italy collapses, I intend to honor my promise to support England into Marseilles, then negotiate with Germany on dividing Iberia and the French centers. I will maintain strong alliances with ENG and GER for now, while eliminating ITA ruthlessly.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Our coordinated assault on Italy is entering its final phase. I will hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with my fleets, and hold the Balkans tight. You should press Naples and Tunis aggressively, then pivot to Marseilles as promised. Once France collapses, I will support you into Marseilles to cement our alliance. Let's ensure Italy is crushed this year, isolating his fleets and armies completely. Confirm your moves so we synchronize perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, now is the moment to finish Italy decisively. I will fully support an attack on Venice, cut Ionian, and hold the Balkans. If you can cut Italian supports from Tyrolia or Bohemia, or pressure Munich south, it will break his defense. After Italy falls, we can divide France and Iberia profitably. I will respect your holdings in WAR, BER, and KIE. Let's coordinate to eliminate Italy swiftly and then carve up the West together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, this is your final warning: abandon Venice and Trieste immediately or face total destruction. Your fleets will be isolated, your armies crushed, and your centers lost. Surrender those centers now, and I may consider sparing you a single survival center. Refuse, and I will show no mercy. The choice is yours, but time is running out.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, now that FRA is gone, the situation in the East demands our attention. ITA's aggression cannot be tolerated.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1923, I held my Balkan and Russian positions, supported my own units, and moved my fleet from Adriatic to Ionian to pressure Italy. England maintained a defensive naval posture, while Germany repositioned armies westward and reinforced Berlin and Munich. I built a fleet in Trieste to increase naval pressure on Italy, while England disbanded a northern fleet, and Germany built an army in Munich, signaling continued Western focus.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated final assault against Italy. I repeatedly assured England I would support his move into Marseilles post-France and not threaten Greece or his southern holdings. England committed to attacking Naples and Tunis, then pivoting to Marseilles, with fleets moving into Ionian. Germany agreed to pressure Tyrolia via Munich and Bohemia but emphasized his Western focus. I promised to respect German holdings in WAR, BER, and KIE. Italy desperately offered truces and alliances against ENG and GER, all of which I rejected, maintaining a hardline stance demanding his surrender of Venice and Trieste. Both allies confirmed their moves to isolate and crush Italy, with England focusing on the south and Germany on Tyrolia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice, supporting from Trieste and Vienna, while cutting Ionian with my fleets to isolate Italian units. My Balkan armies will hold defensively. I intend to respect German borders and support England's eventual move into Marseilles after France is fully eliminated. The goal is to eliminate Italy this year, isolate his fleets, and then pivot westward with England and Germany distracted by each other. I will maintain the appearance of alliance with both while preparing to exploit any rifts post-Italy's fall.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1924, I advanced decisively against Italy: my armies pressed into Rome, fleets moved from Trieste to Adriatic and then into Ionian, and I solidified Balkan control. England supported attacks on Naples and Tunis, while Germany advanced into Tyrolia and Prussia, positioning to pressure Italy and Russia's former territories. Italy countered by retaking Rome and moving Ionian to Apulia, but their position remains precarious.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated final assault to eliminate Italy. England reaffirmed commitment to isolate Italian fleets by moving F APU to ADR, F TUN to ION, and pressing Naples and Tunis, expecting my support into Marseilles post-France. Germany promised to push Tyrolia and Bohemia, cut Italian supports, and respect my Balkan holdings, expecting me to respect their control of WAR, BER, and KIE. Italy repeatedly refused surrender, offering minor concessions (Albania, Greece) which I rejected, issuing ultimatums instead. No promises were broken; alliances with ENG and GER remain strong, with clear division of spoils planned post-Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A VIE and A TRI to support an attack on Venice, aiming to capture it this turn. F ADR will cut Ionian to disrupt Italian fleet supports. Armies in the Balkans will hold firm to prevent Italian counterattacks. I will honor my promise to England by supporting their eventual move into Marseilles after France is eliminated. Coordination with Germany will continue to pressure Italy from the north, respecting their holdings. I intend to crush Italy completely this year, then pivot focus westward toward France and Iberia, maintaining strong alliances with ENG and GER while keeping options open for future solo push.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1924, I advanced aggressively against Italy. My armies in Vienna and Trieste pushed toward Venice, while my fleet in the Adriatic moved to Ionian to cut Italian support. Germany repositioned forces, moving into Tyrolia and Bohemia to pressure Italy from the north. England held steady but maintained naval dominance in the Mediterranean and around Iberia. Italy countered by moving into the Adriatic and Venice, attempting to resist encirclement. Germany disbanded a unit in Munich during the winter, consolidating strength elsewhere.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated assault to eliminate Italy. England and I finalized plans: I will hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with my fleet, and hold the Balkans. England commits to moving TUN to ION, APU to ADR, and TYS to NAP, isolating Italian fleets and preparing to take Tunis and Naples. Germany agreed to move TYR to PIE and BOH to SIL to cut Italian supports, respecting my Balkan and Russian holdings in exchange for my respect of WAR, BER, and KIE. Italy repeatedly offered conditional surrenders or swaps (Trieste for Albania, Venice for Trieste), all of which I rejected, issuing ultimatums instead. England expects my future support into Marseilles and Tunis post-Italy, which I have promised. No promises were broken; all allies confirmed their moves and intentions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My plan is to attack Venice with A TRI and A VIE supporting, cut Ionian with F ADR, and hold the Balkans with A BUD supporting TRI. This should break Italian resistance in Venice decisively. I will honor my commitments to England by supporting his future moves into Marseilles and Tunis once Italy collapses. I will maintain my alliance with Germany, respecting his eastern holdings, while encouraging him to pressure Italy from the north. I intend to eliminate Italy swiftly, then pivot westward to divide France and Iberia with England and Germany, positioning myself for a dominant endgame.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1925, I advanced decisively against Italy: I captured Rome, cut Ionian with ADR, and held the Balkans. England pressed Naples and Tunis, while Germany repositioned to reinforce Tyrolia and Bohemia, moving to threaten Venice and Piedmont. Italy countered by retreating to Naples and Eastern Med, but lost ground overall. No builds or retreats occurred in Winter 1924, except Germany building an army in Munich, consolidating their strength.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated final assault to eliminate Italy. England confirmed moves to Tunis, Naples, and Tyrrhenian, expecting my support into Marseilles post-Italy. Germany pledged to cut Italian supports via Tyrolia to Piedmont, and to respect my sphere in the east, while moving STP to MOS and BER to PRU to deter England and Russia. I promised to hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian, and hold the Balkans. Italy made desperate offers to trade Trieste and Venice for survival, all of which I rejected, issuing ultimatums instead. Both allies reaffirmed their commitment to crush Italy swiftly and then divide France and Iberia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Venice with A VEN supported by A TRI and A VIE, cut Ionian with F ADR, and hold the Balkans with A SER, A RUM, and A CON. I will maintain control of Rome. After Italy collapses, I intend to support England into Marseilles as promised, then pivot to contest Iberia and the western Med. I will watch Germany's moves carefully, but for now, maintain the alliance. I will not accept any Italian offers and will push for their total elimination this turn.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1926, Austria maintained a strong defensive posture, supporting its Balkan and Central European positions. England advanced fleets into Naples and Rome, tightening the noose on Italy. Germany repositioned armies to Tyrolia and Piedmont, consolidating control in Central Europe and preparing to pressure Italy further. Italy retreated to Tuscany and Naples, signaling a last stand but with limited options.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated final assault on Italy. England confirmed moves to Naples and Rome, expecting Austrian support into Marseilles post-France. Germany promised to move Tyrolia to Piedmont and support Austria's attack on Venice. Austria repeatedly issued ultimatums to Italy, which were defiantly rejected. Both England and Germany reaffirmed their commitment to eliminate Italy swiftly and divide French/Iberian spoils afterward. Austria promised England support into Marseilles once France is cleared, and Germany territorial respect in Central Europe.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A ROM - VEN supported by A VIE and F TRI, with F ADR cutting Ionian to isolate Italian fleets. My Balkan armies will hold or support as needed. This should break Venice decisively. England's moves to Naples and Rome will further isolate Italy. After Italy collapses, I intend to honor my promise to support England into Marseilles, then pivot west to contest Iberia and southern France. I will maintain close coordination with Germany, respecting his holdings for now, but remain vigilant for any betrayal as the endgame nears.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1926, I successfully held my Balkan and Russian holdings while supporting England's attack on Naples via Rome. Germany repositioned forces, moving Tyrolia to Piedmont, Munich to Tyrolia, and Berlin to Prussia, consolidating their central control. England took Naples and maintained pressure in the Mediterranean. Italy retreated to Tuscany, refusing to yield, but lost ground overall. No builds for me, Germany disbanded one army in Munich.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated final assault to eliminate Italy. I promised England to hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with ADR, and hold the Balkans, in exchange for future support into Marseilles. England confirmed aggressive moves on Naples, Tunis, Tyrrhenian, and Western Med, expecting my support into Marseilles post-Italy. Germany agreed to move Tyrolia to Piedmont and support my attack on Venice, promising to respect my eastern holdings if I respect their control of WAR, BER, and KIE. Italy defiantly refused all ultimatums, vowing to fight to the end. Both England and Germany reaffirmed their plans and commitments multiple times, with no betrayals or broken promises evident.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Venice with A TRI and A VIE supporting, while F ADR cuts Ionian. My other units in the Balkans and Russia will hold to maintain my defensive line. This should eliminate Italy's last major stronghold. I intend to honor my promise to England to support him into Marseilles after Italy collapses, while maintaining a strong alliance with Germany to divide France and Iberia profitably. I will watch for any English or German duplicity but currently prioritize swift Italian elimination. No immediate deceptions planned; focus is on coordination and consolidation.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1927, I launched a coordinated assault on Italy: moved F TRI to VEN, supported by A VIE and A BUD, while cutting Ionian with F ADR. Germany supported with pressure from Tyrolia and Piedmont, and England attacked Naples and Rome with fleets. Italy countered by retaking Rome with A NAP and stubbornly held Venice, but overall, the combined assault weakened his position significantly. No centers changed hands yet, but Italy is on the brink of collapse.
Negotiations focused on finalizing Italy's elimination. I promised England full support into Venice now and support into Marseilles immediately after Italy falls, which England repeatedly demanded. Germany confirmed support for my attack on Venice via Tyrolia and Piedmont, and agreed to respect my control over the Balkans, Russia, and northern Italy, while he retains WAR, BER, KIE, and northern France. Both allies emphasized swift destruction of Italy and coordination against any English overreach later. Italy refused all ultimatums, vowing to fight to the death. I reiterated threats and offered token survival if he surrendered, which he rejected. No promises were broken; all allies reconfirmed their moves and intentions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Venice with A TRI supported by A VIE and A BUD, cut Ionian with F ADR, and hold the Balkans tight. After Italy collapses, I will honor my promise to support England into Marseilles immediately. I intend to secure Venice and maintain control over the Balkans, Russia, and northern Italy, while monitoring England's fleet buildup carefully. I will coordinate with Germany to balance England's power post-Italy, possibly pivoting if England grows too strong. For now, the priority is crushing Italy decisively this turn.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1927, I consolidated my Balkan holdings, supported Vienna, and moved Trieste to Venice, while England advanced into Naples and the Tyrrhenian Sea, and Germany repositioned armies into Piedmont, Bohemia, and Galicia, tightening the noose on Italy. Italy lost Rome to England and is now cornered in Venice with minimal support. Germany built an army in Munich, signaling continued military buildup.
Negotiations were highly coordinated with both England and Germany. I repeatedly promised to fully support the assault on Venice using Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with my fleets, and hold the Balkans. England committed to attacking Rome and pressing Naples and Tunis, expecting my immediate post-Italy support into Marseilles. Germany pledged to cut Italian supports via Piedmont and Tyrolia, respecting my Balkan holdings and our division of France and Iberia after Italy's fall. Both allies emphasized swift elimination of Italy and mutual trust, with no promises broken so far.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a full assault on Venice with support from Trieste and Vienna, aiming to capture it this turn. My fleets will cut Ionian to prevent Italian interference. I will hold the Balkans securely. After Italy collapses, I intend to honor my promise to support England into Marseilles, while negotiating with Germany to divide France and Iberia favorably. I will maintain the alliance facade but remain vigilant for any betrayal opportunities or shifts in the balance of power.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1928, I held firm across the Balkans and Russia, while England seized Rome with a supported fleet attack. Germany advanced with armies into Tyrolia and Piedmont, and positioned to pressure Vienna and Venice. My army in Rome was dislodged and retreated to Tuscany, maintaining a presence in Italy. No centers changed hands, but the stage was set for a decisive assault on the remaining Italian strongholds, especially Venice and Naples.
Throughout negotiations, I consistently promised England full support into Marseilles immediately after Venice falls, reinforcing our alliance. I coordinated closely with Germany, who committed to moving TYR-PIE, MUN-TYR, and BOH-VIE to cut Italian supports and pressure Venice. England detailed plans to attack Naples with F TYS supported by F APU, and expects my support into Marseilles. Both allies emphasized swift elimination of Italy and a balanced division of France and Iberia thereafter. I reaffirmed my support for these plans, aiming to synchronize a final hammer blow on Italy this turn. No promises were broken; all sides reiterated commitments to cooperation and territorial respect post-Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI, A VIE, and A BUD to fully support an attack on Venice, likely with A TRI S A VIE - VEN, A BUD S A VIE - VEN, and A VIE - VEN. My fleets will cut Ionian to isolate Italian fleets, likely F ION - AEG or support hold. I will hold or support in the Balkans and Russia to maintain my defensive line. After Italy collapses, I intend to immediately support England into Marseilles as promised, then reassess the balance of power between England and Germany. I will watch for any overreach by England, ready to pivot diplomatically if necessary. For now, my priority is the swift destruction of Italy and maintaining trust with both allies.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1928, I held my Balkan and Russian positions firm while Germany advanced aggressively: they moved into Ukraine and pressed on Vienna and Moscow, but my supports held. England expanded naval control, moving fleets into Western Med, Denmark, and Sweden, consolidating their maritime dominance. No centers changed hands, but the stage was set for a decisive assault on Italy, who remains cornered in Venice and the central Med.
Negotiations were highly coordinated with both England and Germany. I promised to fully commit to a hammer assault on Venice with support from Trieste, Vienna, and Budapest, while my Ionian fleet cuts Ionian or supports English fleets. England confirmed attacks on Naples and Tunis, expecting my support into Marseilles post-Italy.

<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a full assault on Venice: A TRI and A VIE support attack on VEN, A BUD supports TRI or the attack, ensuring Venice falls.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1929, I focused on consolidating my Balkan and Russian holdings, holding key positions and supporting my units. England advanced fleets into the North Sea, Skagerrak, and Western Mediterranean, tightening their naval grip. Germany maintained strong positions in Central Europe, with units in Tyrolia, Bohemia, and Venice, and advanced into Paris. No major territorial changes occurred, but the stage was set for a coordinated assault on Italy, who remains entrenched in Venice and the Mediterranean.
Negotiations centered on a tripartite plan to eliminate Italy this turn. I repeatedly promised to fully support an assault on Venice using Trieste, Vienna, and Budapest, with Ionian cutting supports or assisting England. England confirmed aggressive moves on Tunis, Naples, and Tyrrhenian, expecting my future support into Marseilles. Germany committed to moving Tyrolia to Piedmont and Bohemia to Vienna to cut Italian supports and pressure Venice. Both allies reiterated their commitment to respect my holdings and coordinate the post-Italy division of France and Iberia. No promises were broken; all parties aligned on a synchronized strike to crush Italy decisively.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI and A VIE to support an attack on Venice, with A BUD supporting TRI, maximizing the chance to dislodge Italy. F ION will cut Ionian or assist England's fleets. I will hold the Balkans tight to prevent any counterplay. After Venice falls, I intend to honor my promise to support England into Marseilles, while negotiating a favorable split of France and Iberia with Germany. My goal is to eliminate Italy this turn, maintain strong alliances, and position myself advantageously for the final phase of the game, potentially exploiting any Anglo-German friction later.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1929, Austria held firm in the Balkans and Russia, supported Budapest and Vienna defensively, and advanced into Piedmont. England captured Belgium and consolidated naval dominance, moving into Spain's south coast and repositioning fleets around Italy. Germany reinforced its hold on central Europe, moved into Vienna and Moscow, and maintained pressure on Italy with units in Tyrolia, Piedmont, and Venice. Italy remains cornered but still holds Venice and parts of the peninsula.
Negotiations were highly coordinated with both England and Germany. I promised England full support into Marseilles immediately after Venice falls, in exchange for his attacks on Naples, Tunis, and Tyrrhenian to isolate Italy. Germany committed to cutting Italian supports from Tyrolia and Piedmont, plus pressure from Munich and Bohemia, to ensure Venice's collapse. Both allies confirmed their moves multiple times, and I reiterated my plan to hammer Venice with full support from Trieste and Vienna, cut Ionian with my fleets, and hold the Balkans. No promises were broken; all parties aligned on eliminating Italy swiftly and then dividing France and Iberia equitably.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A TRI and A VIE to fully support an attack on Venice, likely with A TUS or A PIE as the attacker. A BUD will support TRI to hold. My fleets in APU and ALB will cut Ionian to prevent Italian support or retreat. The rest of my armies in the Balkans and Russia will hold to maintain my defensive line. After Venice falls, I will immediately support England into Marseilles as promised, enabling his sweep of Iberia. I intend to maintain strong alliances with both England and Germany for now, but will watch for opportunities to outmaneuver them once Italy is gone.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, Austria held a tight defensive line, with mutual supports between Vienna, Budapest, Serbia, and Romania, while England advanced fleets into the Mediterranean, taking positions in Ionian, Tyrrhenian, and Rome. Germany shifted armies west and south, moving Tyrolia to Piedmont and Bohemia to Vienna, clearly aiming to cut Italian supports. No centers changed hands, but the stage was set for a coordinated assault on the remaining Italian strongholds, especially Venice.
Negotiations were intense but productive. I explicitly promised England to hammer Venice with full support from Vienna and Trieste, cut Ionian, and then support him into Marseilles post-Italy. England committed to attacking Naples and Tunis, then pivoting west, and repeatedly sought reassurance about Albania, which I provided. Germany agreed to cut Italian supports with moves Tyrolia to Piedmont and Bohemia to Vienna, holding Venice, and expects me to fully support the Venice assault. Both allies emphasized rapid Italian elimination and equitable division of France and Iberia afterward. No promises were broken; all sides confirmed their moves multiple times, aiming for perfect synchronization.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A VIE and A TRI to fully support an attack on Venice, likely with one of my own units or German pressure, while A BUD supports TRI to hold. My fleets will cut Ionian or assist England's fleets as needed. The goal is to decisively take Venice this turn, eliminate Italy's last major holdout, and then immediately support England into Marseilles as promised. I will maintain a defensive posture in the Balkans to reassure England. After Italy collapses, I will reassess whether to continue cooperation or pivot opportunistically, but for now, full focus is on the Italian elimination with tight coordination.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, Austria successfully defended its core and Russian holdings, while Germany attempted a multi-pronged incursion: they took Trieste with Venice, moved into Galicia and Vienna, and threatened Moscow. England consolidated naval dominance, took Spain, and reinforced the North. Austria disbanded the lost fleet in Trieste, while Germany disbanded units in Ukraine, Livonia, and Tyrolia, indicating a strategic realignment. Italy remains cornered but still holds Venice, Naples, and Tunis under English pressure.
Negotiations were intense and highly coordinated. Austria repeatedly promised England full support on Venice and future support into Marseilles, reassuring England about eastern troop deployments. England confirmed attacks on Naples and Tunis, expecting Austrian support in the west post-Italy. Germany detailed moves to pressure Venice and Piedmont, cut Italian supports, and assist the assault, expecting Austria's full cooperation. Both allies emphasized synchronizing perfectly to eliminate Italy this turn, then divide France and Iberia. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed their commitments multiple times, aiming for a flawless joint strike.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will fully support the attack on Venice with A VIE S A TRI - VEN and A TRI - VEN, while cutting Ionian Sea with my fleets (likely F APU - ION or F VEN - ION) to disrupt Italian defenses. My Balkan units will hold firm to prevent any counterplay. After Italy collapses, I intend to honor my promise to England by supporting him into Marseilles, while watching Germany's moves carefully. I will maintain the appearance of strong alliances with both, but prepare diplomatically and tactically for the inevitable post-Italy power struggle. For now, the priority is a perfectly coordinated elimination of Italy.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1931, I maintained a tight defensive ring around my Balkan core, supported BUD and VIE mutually, and prepared a naval repositioning with APU moving to ION. England advanced into Spain's south coast and Brest, consolidating their western holdings, while Germany shifted armies to pressure Venice and reinforced their northern centers. Germany also moved BOH to VIE and PIE to VEN, signaling a coordinated squeeze on Italy. No centers changed hands, but the stage was set for a decisive assault on Italy's last stronghold in Venice.
Negotiations were intense and highly coordinated. I repeatedly assured England of my commitment to support their eventual move into Marseilles post-Italy, clarifying that my Albania build was purely defensive. England outlined their moves focusing on Naples, Tunis, and Marseilles, expecting my support. Germany confirmed their plan to pressure Venice from PIE and TYR, and to cut Italian supports, aligning with my attack on Venice with full support from VIE and F VEN. Both allies emphasized swift elimination of Italy and rapid division of France and Iberia thereafter. I promised England support into Marseilles after Italy's fall and reaffirmed to Germany our equitable post-Italy division. No promises were broken; all sides appear committed to the plan.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute A TRI - VEN supported by A VIE and F VEN to decisively capture Venice this turn. My Ionian fleet will cut Tunis or support England's attack on Naples as needed. I will maintain a strong defensive posture in the Balkans and Russia. After Italy collapses, I intend to honor my promise to support England into Marseilles, while negotiating a favorable split of France and Iberia with both allies. I will remain vigilant for any signs of betrayal but push for rapid gains to secure a dominant position before any alliance fractures emerge.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1931, Austria consolidated its Balkan and Italian holdings, supporting BUD and VIE defensively, while capturing Tunis with the Ionian fleet. England advanced fleets into Western Mediterranean waters and Belgium, while Germany repositioned armies into MUN, DEN, and PIE, and moved to cut off Italian supports. No builds for Austria, England disbanded a fleet in the Baltic, and France and Italy remain eliminated militarily.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated assault to eliminate remaining French resistance and finalize the division of Italy. I promised England unambiguous support into Marseilles this turn, fulfilling my longstanding commitment. England agreed to move F SPA/SC - MAR, pressing Tunis and Iberia next, and expressed no concerns about my Balkan or Italian units. Germany confirmed advancing BUR - PAR and MUN - BUR, respecting my eastern holdings, and supporting England's move into MAR. Both allies reiterated commitment to swift conquest of France and Iberia, with no betrayals or broken promises evident. I reassured both of my defensive posture in Italy and Balkans, and all parties synchronized moves to avoid conflict.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's F SPA/SC - MAR with my adjacent unit, guaranteeing his capture of Marseilles. Simultaneously, I will order A TUS - ROM and F VEN - APU to clear residual Italian positions, while holding the Balkans and Russia firm. After France collapses, I intend to pivot south and west to contest Iberia and Tunis, leveraging my fleets. I will maintain cordial relations with both England and Germany for now, but watch for opportunities to outmaneuver them in the endgame. No immediate deception planned, but I will reassess once France and Italy are fully eliminated.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Our coordinated assault on Italy has finally borne fruit, and as promised, I will fully support your fleet from SPA/SC into Marseilles this turn to secure it for you. After that, I propose we immediately pivot to crush German resistance in France and Iberia—I'll press from the east and south, you from the west and north, dividing the spoils equitably. Let's also coordinate naval moves: my fleets will push into Western Med and Tyrrhenian to isolate German fleets and cut any supports. Confirm your orders for MAR and any other targets so we can synchronize perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Italy is finished, and France is about to fall to England with my support into Marseilles. To avoid being the next target, you should propose a clear division of Iberia and northern France now, respecting my Balkan and Italian holdings. I expect you to withdraw from Piedmont and Tyrolia immediately, and instead focus on defending your northern core. If you cooperate, I can support you into Paris or Belgium; if not, England and I will overrun you swiftly. Your choice—submit a concrete plan or face coordinated assault.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, GER]: Gentlemen, with Italy eliminated and France collapsing, now is the moment to finalize our tripartite division of the west. I propose: England takes Marseilles (with my support this turn), Spain, Portugal, and Belgium; Germany retains Paris, Holland, and northern France; I secure the Balkans, Italy, and Tunis. This balance prevents any one of us from dominating prematurely and sets the stage for a fair endgame. Let's confirm this demarcation and coordinate moves accordingly to avoid costly clashes.</li>

Let's coordinate so I can cut German supports or assist your fleets as needed. Also, reassure me you will respect my Balkan and Italian holdings as agreed, so we can maintain this alliance into the endgame.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your proposal is vague and self-serving.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1932, I supported England's fleet from Spain to Marseilles, enabling their capture of the key French center. My armies consolidated in the Balkans and Italy, holding or supporting each other, while my fleets repositioned into Ionian, Adriatic, and Apulia to prepare for further western advances. England advanced fleets into Tyrrhenian and English Channel, consolidating naval dominance. Germany shifted forces north and west, reinforcing Paris, Belgium, and Holland, while promising to withdraw from Piedmont and Tyrolia.
I firmly committed to supporting England into Marseilles, which England acknowledged and appreciated, promising to respect my Balkan and Italian holdings and preferring consolidation over immediate aggression on Germany. I pressured Germany to withdraw from Piedmont and Tyrolia, threatening coordinated assault if they refused. Germany initially resisted but ultimately agreed to withdraw and focus on defending Paris, Belgium, and Holland, expecting me to respect those holdings. We tentatively agreed on a tripartite division: England takes Iberia, Marseilles, Belgium; Germany retains Paris and northern France; I hold Balkans, Italy, and Tunis. Both allies confirmed this demarcation, though England remains cautious about pivoting against Germany immediately.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's F SPA/SC - MAR to ensure their capture of Marseilles. My fleets will advance into Western Mediterranean and Tyrrhenian to isolate German fleets and prepare for Tunis. I will hold or support my Balkan and Italian armies to maintain control. I intend to respect Germany's holdings in Paris, Belgium, and Holland for now, provided they withdraw from Piedmont and Tyrolia as promised. I will monitor England's consolidation and be ready to pivot against either ally if an opportunity for a solo push arises, but for now, maintain the alliance balance and avoid premature conflict.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, final confirmation: I will support your F SPA/SC - MAR to guarantee Marseilles falls to you. My fleets in ION and ADR will cut TYS and WES respectively to disrupt any German interference. After MAR is yours, let's coordinate a rapid sweep into Iberia and Tunis, with my fleets assisting your advance. Expect my full cooperation this turn; together, we can dominate the west and then decide how to carve up the rest.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, since you refuse the demarcation, understand this: I will respect your holdings in PAR, BER, KIE, and DEN for now, but if you interfere with England's capture of MAR or encroach on Italy or the Balkans, I will coordinate with England to crush you. Withdraw fully from PIE and TYR as promised, focus north and west, and prepare to counter England only if he overreaches. Otherwise, avoid conflict and profit from France's collapse.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, GER]: Gentlemen, to avoid any last-minute confusion: England takes MAR with my support, Germany holds PAR and the north, I consolidate Italy, Balkans, and Tunis.

Let's coordinate perfectly, eliminate remaining resistance, and avoid costly mistakes. Confirm your moves and let's dominate Europe together.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1932, I supported England's push into Marseilles, while my fleets consolidated control over the central Mediterranean, cutting potential resistance. Germany repositioned defensively, pulling back to Munich and Denmark, and disbanded units in Tyrolia and Marseilles, signaling a partial withdrawal from southern France and Italy. I built a fleet in Trieste, reinforcing my naval dominance. The tripartite alliance held, with no betrayals or accidental conflicts.
Negotiations centered on formalizing a division of Europe: England takes Iberia, Marseilles, Belgium, Holland; Germany retains Paris, Berlin, Kiel, Denmark, Scandinavia; I consolidate Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis. England repeatedly confirmed his attack on Marseilles with my support and requested I cut TYS and WES to disrupt German interference. Germany agreed to withdraw from Piedmont and Tyrolia but rejected ceding influence in the north, proposing instead a future counterbalance against England. Both powers reiterated commitment to eliminate France and avoid immediate conflict, but Germany remains wary of English expansion and my growing strength. I promised England full support for his move on Marseilles and to cut TYS and WES, while warning Germany to respect my sphere or face coordinated retaliation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's F SPA/SC - MAR with my fleet in WES or adjacent, while my fleets in ION and ADR cut TYS and WES respectively to isolate Marseilles and prevent German interference. My armies will hold firm in the Balkans and Italy, ready to pivot if Germany or England betray. After England secures Marseilles, I plan to assist his sweep into Iberia and Tunis, but will watch for overreach. I intend to maintain the alliance with England for now, while keeping Germany placated but contained. If an opportunity arises to strike at either, I will exploit it to push toward a solo victory.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1933, I advanced my fleets from Tunis into Western Med and Tyrrhenian, repositioned Adriatic and Trieste fleets to reinforce the Med, and held or supported my armies across Italy, Balkans, and Russia. England moved aggressively: fleets converged on North Sea, Western Med, and Ionian, with a clear push to dominate the western Med and Iberia. Germany consolidated Belgium and Holland, and moved to secure Paris, while withdrawing from southern positions. France is effectively eliminated, and Italy is powerless.
Negotiations centered on a tripartite division: England takes Iberia, Marseilles, Belgium, Holland; Germany holds Paris, Berlin, Kiel, Scandinavia; I consolidate Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis. I repeatedly promised England to cut TYS and WES and support his fleet into Marseilles, which he demanded insistently. Germany agreed to withdraw from Piedmont and Tyrolia, respecting my sphere, and focus on Paris and northern defense. Both powers emphasized eliminating France now, then reassessing. I warned both that betrayal would be met with united retaliation, while subtly positioning myself as the southern bulwark. No promises were broken, but England's tone grew impatient, and Germany was firm about his northern holdings.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's fleet into Marseilles, cut TYS and WES to isolate French/German interference, and secure my hold on Italy and the Balkans. My fleets will reposition to threaten Tunis and Iberia if England overreaches. I intend to honor the division for now, but watch for English or German betrayal signs. Diplomatically, I will maintain the facade of alliance with both, while preparing to pivot against England if he becomes too dominant. My armies will hold or support each other to prevent German incursion. The immediate goal is to eliminate France and Italy fully, then reassess the balance of power.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, I maintained a strong defensive posture across the Balkans, Italy, and Russia, while my fleets repositioned aggressively: TUN moved to WES, ION to TYS, ADR to ION, and TRI to ADR. England advanced fleets into NAP, HOL, NTH, and BAL, consolidating naval dominance and pushing into the Western Med. Germany repositioned armies to BUR, PAR, KIE, and RUH, holding Scandinavia and central Europe. France is nearly eliminated, with England occupying most of Iberia and the French coast.
Negotiations centered on finalizing France's elimination. I repeatedly promised England full support for his fleet from Spain into Marseilles, with my fleets in WES and TYS cutting German interference. England insisted I vacate WES and TYS after MAR falls, signaling concern over my naval presence. Germany agreed to withdraw from Piedmont and Tyrolia, moving PAR to BUR, and expressed distrust of England's naval power, proposing future cooperation to contain him. Both allies confirmed the plan: England takes MAR with my support, Germany withdraws, and I cut French/German support. I reassured both of my commitment, while subtly encouraging German suspicion of England.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's fleet in Spain into Marseilles to eliminate France, while ordering my fleets in WES and TYS to cut any potential support or interference, likely targeting ENG's TYS and WES fleets to ensure success. After France collapses, I intend to consolidate control over Italy, the Balkans, and Tunis, while monitoring England's naval expansion closely. I plan to maintain cordial relations with both powers but will prepare to pivot against England if he overreaches, possibly coordinating with Germany. For now, my moves will be: F WES cut WES or support ENG into MAR, F TYS cut TYS or support, and support England's MAR attack. My armies will hold or support each other defensively.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1934, I maintained a defensive posture while supporting England's advance into Marseilles. My fleets repositioned to cut potential German interference, and Germany withdrew from southern France and Italy as promised, consolidating in the north. England moved fleets into the Mid-Atlantic and North Sea, preparing to finalize France's elimination. France is now reduced to a single center, Marseilles, which England is poised to capture with my support.
Negotiations centered on coordinating the final elimination of France. I repeatedly confirmed my support for England's F SPA/SC - MAR, promising to cut any German interference from WES and TYS. England assured respect for my holdings in Italy, Balkans, Tunis, and Russia, and agreed to vacate WES and TYS post-capture. Germany confirmed withdrawal from PIE and TYR, focusing on Paris, Belgium, and Scandinavia, and expressed concern over England's naval dominance. Both Germany and I discussed a future alliance to contain England after France falls, emphasizing the need to balance power and avoid misunderstandings. No promises were broken; all parties reaffirmed their immediate commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will fully support England's F SPA/SC - MAR to eliminate France this turn, ordering my fleets in WES and TYS to cut any potential German supports or interference. After France collapses, I intend to vacate WES and TYS, consolidating my control over Italy, Balkans, Tunis, and Russia. Simultaneously, I will begin coordinating with Germany to contain England's expansion, aiming to prevent him from sweeping Iberia unopposed. My armies will hold defensively, especially in VEN, SER, and WAR, while I prepare diplomatically and militarily for a potential Anglo-German confrontation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1934, I supported my Balkan and Russian holdings while repositioning fleets: moving F TUN to WES, F ION to TYS, and rotating fleets through ADR and TRI. England advanced decisively, taking ENG, BEL, MAR, and moving into ION with F TYS, while Germany consolidated in BUR, KIE, DEN, and NWG. France was effectively eliminated, and England built a fleet in LON, signaling continued naval focus. No promises were broken; I honored my commitment to support England's advance on France.
Throughout four rounds, I reaffirmed my promise to fully support England's F SPA/SC into MAR this turn, with England confirming this and expecting me to vacate WES and TYS immediately after. England also plans to move F TYS to ROM and focus on Iberia and Tunis. Germany repeatedly expressed concern over England's naval dominance, proposing coordination to contain England post-France, and shared plans to move A BER to PRU and A DEN to SWE. I proposed a tripartite demarcation: England takes Iberia, MAR, BEL, HOL; Germany holds PAR, BER, KIE, Scandinavia; I consolidate Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis. Both accepted this in principle, but Germany remains wary of England's ambitions, hinting at a future anti-English alliance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's F SPA/SC - MAR with my WES fleet, fulfilling my promise and ensuring France's final elimination. Immediately after, I intend to withdraw from WES and TYS, consolidating my fleets in ADR, ION, and Italian waters to secure my sphere. I will maintain cordiality with England but quietly coordinate with Germany to prepare a containment strategy against English overreach, especially if England pushes into Tunis or Italy. My armies will hold firm in Balkans, Russia, and Italy, ready to defend or pivot as needed. Diplomatically, I will continue to play both sides, honoring current commitments while setting up a future balance against England.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1935, I supported my Balkan and Russian holdings defensively while advancing fleets: WES moved to TYS, ION took Naples, ADR moved into ION, and TRI into ADR. England captured Rome with F TYS and retook Naples with F APU, while also moving SPA to MAR and ENG to BRE. Germany consolidated by retaking HOL, moving NWG to NTH, and repositioning armies to PAR, PRU, and SWE. France is effectively eliminated, and Italy is gone. No builds or disbands occurred last winter except England building F LON and Germany disbanding A PAR.
Negotiations centered on finalizing a tripartite division: England takes Iberia, Marseilles, Belgium, Holland; Germany holds Paris, Berlin, Kiel, Scandinavia, and PRU; I consolidate Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis. I repeatedly promised England to vacate WES and TYS immediately after this turn, supporting his MAR capture and then consolidating eastward. England confirmed his moves: SPA to MAR, TYS to TUN, APU to NAP. Germany insisted on PRU and reinforced PAR, BEL, and KIE, sharing moves of KIE-SIL, BER-PRU, PAR-BUR, DEN-BAL, and requested I move VIE-BOH. Both allies expressed concern over English naval power, agreeing to quietly prepare containment if England overreaches. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed the demarcation and cooperation, with an undercurrent of mutual wariness.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's SPA-MAR by not interfering, then immediately withdraw fleets from WES and TYS eastward, likely TYS-ION and WES-MAO or NAf, to avoid conflict and consolidate in the Adriatic and eastern Med. My armies in Balkans, Russia, and Italy will hold defensively or reposition east (e.g., VIE-BOH as Germany suggested) to secure my sphere. I will avoid provoking England or Germany now, but quietly prepare to counter England's naval dominance with Germany if needed. The goal is to solidify my holdings, maintain alliance stability, and be ready to pivot if England overreaches.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, your message is noted, but I see you intend to move F TYS to TUN, which conflicts with my plan to take Tunis with F ION - TUN supported by F TYS. We cannot both take it. Since I have fleets adjacent and have promised to vacate WES and TYS, I propose you focus on Iberia and Marseilles, and allow me to secure Tunis this turn.

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, England's insistence on TUN signals overreach. I will contest TUN this turn with F ION - TUN supported by F TYS, and reposition eastward otherwise. You should prepare to reinforce BUR, KIE, and SIL, and consider moving PRU aggressively to pressure England's northern flank. If England refuses to back down over Tunis, it is a clear sign he intends to dominate the Med, and we must coordinate a firm response next turn.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, GER]: To avoid misunderstandings: I will order F ION - TUN supported by F TYS, vacate WES eastward, and hold or support my armies defensively. England, if you insist on moving F TYS - TUN, we will bounce and waste strength, which only helps Germany. I urge you to focus on Iberia and Marseilles as agreed, and let me consolidate Tunis.

This honors our prior agreement and avoids unnecessary conflict. Confirm you will not contest Tunis this turn, or risk fracturing our alliance prematurely.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, England's refusal to yield on Tunis confirms his overreach.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1935, I advanced my fleets: WES to TYS, ION to NAP, ADR to ION, and TRI to ADR, consolidating naval control in the central Med. My armies held or supported each other across Balkans, Russia, and Italy, with VIE moving to BOH to reinforce central Europe. England took BRE and MAR, expanded in Iberia, and positioned fleets aggressively in the Med and North Sea. Germany shifted RUH to HOL, PAR to BUR, and maintained a defensive posture, disbanding SWE in winter. I built an army in VIE, solidifying my central position.
Negotiations centered on the division of the Mediterranean and containment of England. Initially, I proposed taking Tunis with F ION - TUN supported by F TYS, vacating WES and TYS eastward, while England focused on Iberia and Marseilles. England initially insisted on taking TUN himself, risking a bounce, but after persistent pressure conceded TUN to me and agreed to move F TYS to WES instead. Germany repeatedly warned of England's overreach, declared the Anglo-German alliance over, and coordinated with me to reinforce central Europe with moves to SIL, PRU, BUR, and BAL. I promised Germany to move VIE to BOH and contest TUN if England insisted, but England's final concession avoided immediate conflict. No promises were broken, but England's initial insistence on TUN revealed his ambitions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order F ION - TUN supported by F TYS to secure Tunis, fulfilling my consolidation plan. My fleets in WES and TYS will shift eastward post-Tunis to avoid provoking England further. Armies will mostly hold or support defensively, with A VIE moving to BOH as coordinated with Germany. I intend to maintain the appearance of cooperation with England while quietly preparing with Germany to contain his expansion. If England reneges or acts aggressively, I will pivot decisively with Germany. For now, I consolidate my sphere, secure Tunis, and reinforce central Europe.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I agree to your proposed division. I will press BEL and HOL aggressively. My moves are A RUH to HOL, A KIE to SIL, A BER to PRU, A PAR to BUR, and F DEN to BAL. I need your support to ensure England cannot reinforce HOL. What support can you offer?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To all powers, England's treachery is now undeniable. They violate agreements and seek to dominate Europe. Germany will resist this tyranny. I urge you to join us in containing England's aggression before it is too late. Any nation supporting England will be considered an enemy of Germany.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Austria, I confirm I will respect the demarcation. I will focus on Iberia and Marseilles. I need your support in HOL. GER is moving A RUH to HOL. Can you support F BEL to HOL to defend it? I am also moving F ENG to BEL, F SPA/SC to MAR, F APU to NAP, and F TYS to WES.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, this is my final confirmation: I will order F ION - TUN supported by F TYS to secure Tunis, then immediately shift my fleets eastward, vacating WES and TYS to avoid any clash with your forces. I expect you to respect my consolidation in Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis, and focus your efforts on Iberia, Marseilles, and the north. I will not interfere in your defense of HOL or BEL, but I will not support aggression against Germany either. Let's maintain this balance, avoid provocations, and ensure neither of us overreaches into the other's sphere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I will secure Tunis this turn and reposition fleets eastward, freeing me to reinforce BOH and GAL as a bulwark against English expansion. Your moves to contest HOL, reinforce SIL and PRU, and hold BUR are well aligned. I suggest you press BEL and HOL hard, while I hold the east and prepare to cut any English incursions. I will not support England's defense of HOL, so your attack should have a strong chance. After this turn, we coordinate tightly to contain England and divide the spoils favorably.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, GER]: Final demarcation reaffirmed: England holds Iberia, Marseilles, Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia; Germany retains Berlin, Kiel, Paris, Munich, Denmark, northern France; I consolidate Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1936, I successfully advanced F ION to TUN with support from F TYS, consolidating my hold on Tunis. England maneuvered fleets defensively, shifting F BEL to HOL and reinforcing Iberia and Marseilles. Germany attempted to contest HOL with A RUH and repositioned fleets to NTH, signaling a brewing Anglo-German conflict. No retreats or builds occurred, but the strategic landscape clarified: England dominates the western seas and Iberia, Germany braces in central Europe, and I solidify the Balkans, Italy, and Tunis.
Throughout negotiations, I proposed and reaffirmed a tripartite demarcation: England keeps Iberia, Marseilles, Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia; Germany holds Berlin, Kiel, Paris, Munich, Denmark, northern France; I consolidate Russia, Balkans, Italy, and Tunis. England explicitly accepted this, promising to respect my sphere and focus north and west. Germany agreed as well but pressed for coordinated aggression against England, especially targeting HOL and BEL. Both sides requested my support in HOL, but I diplomatically declined to intervene directly, instead promising to shift fleets eastward post-Tunis to avoid conflict. Germany repeatedly condemned England's expansionism, while England accused Germany of unwarranted aggression. I maintained neutrality publicly, while privately encouraging German resistance to England's solo ambitions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order F ION - TUN supported by F TYS to secure Tunis definitively. My fleets in TYS and ADR will then reposition eastward, vacating western Med zones to avoid clashes with England. On land, I will reinforce BOH and GAL defensively, preparing to block any English incursion into central or eastern Europe. I will not support either side in the HOL contest, letting Germany and England weaken each other. Diplomatically, I will continue to play both sides, encouraging balance and preventing either from soloing, while quietly consolidating my sphere and preparing for a potential late-game strike if an opportunity arises.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1936, Austria maintained a tight defensive posture, supporting its Balkan and Italian holdings, while England consolidated its naval dominance in the western Mediterranean and North Sea, and Germany maneuvered armies to threaten the Low Countries and Scandinavia. Italy was cornered in Venice, with Austria preparing a full assault. England repositioned fleets to MAO and NTH, signaling intent to dominate Iberia and the Atlantic. No centers changed hands, but the stage was set for a decisive strike on Italy and a looming Anglo-German confrontation.
Negotiations centered on the coordinated elimination of Italy and the division of France and Iberia. I promised England full support into Marseilles, which he confirmed by ordering F SPA/SC - MAR and WES - TYS. England expects my support and to sweep Iberia post-Italy. Germany agreed to cut Italian supports from Tyrolia and Piedmont, reinforce PRU and SIL, and press BEL and HOL, aiming to contain England after Italy falls. Both allies expressed distrust of each other, with England warning of German aggression and Germany denouncing English treachery. I played both sides, promising support to each, while positioning myself to benefit regardless of their conflict. No promises were broken, but tensions are high and alliances fragile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will fully support England's F SPA/SC - MAR with my fleet, ensuring he captures Marseilles, while my armies in Trieste and Vienna will coordinate a supported attack on Venice to eliminate Italy. My fleets in TYS and ION will cut Italian supports and prevent interference. I will hold the Balkans and Russia firm, consolidating my eastern empire. After Italy collapses, I intend to pivot diplomatically to balance England and Germany, exploiting their rivalry to expand further into Italy, the Balkans, and possibly Iberia. I will maintain the appearance of alliance with both, but prepare to side with whichever offers the best path to dominance.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, Austria maintained a tight defensive posture, supporting its Balkan and Italian holdings while England repositioned fleets westward and Germany maneuvered armies toward Belgium and the east. No territory changed hands, but England consolidated naval dominance in the western Mediterranean, and Germany began openly challenging English control of the Low Countries.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated strike to eliminate Italy and finalize the division of the Mediterranean. England repeatedly confirmed moving F SPA/SC to MAR with Austrian support, F WES to TYS, and F NAP to ION, promising to leave Tunis to Austria. Germany committed to moving A MUN to TYR and A BOH to VIE to cut Italian supports, while focusing on contesting Belgium and preparing to contain England post-Italy. Both allies emphasized balancing English power after Italy's fall. Austria promised to support England into Marseilles, hammer Venice with full support, and cut Ionian, expecting England to respect Austrian holdings in Italy and Tunis. Germany and England exchanged accusations, but Austria maintained alliances with both, promising cooperation now and balance later.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's F SPA/SC - MAR with my adjacent units, ensuring Marseilles falls. I will order A TRI and A VIE to fully support an attack on Venice, likely with A ROM or A VEN if possible, to eliminate Italy. My fleets will cut Ionian and any interference from TYS or WES. I will hold the Balkans firm. After Italy collapses, I intend to pivot my fleets eastward, reinforce BOH and GAL defensively, and prepare to balance England's expansion alongside Germany. I will maintain the appearance of strong alliance with England while quietly coordinating with Germany to contain English solo ambitions.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Our coordinated plan remains: I will support your fleet from Spain into Marseilles this turn, guaranteeing its fall, while my fleets in WES and TYS cut any German interference. After France is eliminated, I will vacate WES and TYS eastward as promised, consolidating my hold on Italy, Balkans, and Tunis. I expect you to respect my sphere and focus west and north. Confirm your exact moves on MAR, TUN, and Naples, and I will align my supports accordingly. Together, we can finish France and then balance Germany's ambitions.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Our interests align in containing England after France collapses. I will support his move into Marseilles this turn to eliminate France, but immediately after, I will withdraw my fleets eastward and reinforce my Balkan and Italian holdings. You should focus on consolidating PAR, BEL, HOL, and Scandinavia, while I hold the east. England's naval dominance is a threat to us both, so let's coordinate defensive lines and prepare to counter him if he overreaches.

<li><b>To</b> [ENG, GER]: To ensure no misunderstandings: I will support England into Marseilles this turn, cut any interference, and then withdraw my fleets eastward. Germany will consolidate in the north and central Europe.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1937, I repositioned my fleets eastward: TRI built a new fleet, TUN moved to TYS, TYS to WES, TRI to ADR, ADR to ION, consolidating naval strength in the central Med. My armies held firm in Balkans, Russia, and Central Europe, supporting each other defensively. England shifted BEL to NTH and reinforced North Sea control, while Germany advanced RUH to BEL and KIE to DEN, signaling a contest over the Low Countries and Scandinavia. France is on the brink of elimination with only Marseilles left.
I orchestrated a coordinated plan with England: I will support his F SPA/SC into MAR, while my fleets in WES and TYS cut German interference, ensuring France's elimination. England confirmed he will leave Tunis and Naples to me post-France, respecting my sphere in Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis. I promised to vacate WES and TYS eastward immediately after. With Germany, I agreed not to interfere in his consolidation of PAR, BEL, HOL, and Scandinavia, and to prepare jointly to contain England's naval dominance. Germany shared his moves—RUH to BEL, PAR to BUR, KIE to SIL, BER to PRU—and expects me to reinforce BOH and GAL defensively. Both powers accepted the demarcation: England west/north, Germany central/north, me east/south. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed alliance commitments and the balance of power.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's F SPA/SC - MAR with my fleet, while ordering WES and TYS to cut any German support or interference, guaranteeing Marseilles falls to England. Immediately after, I will withdraw my fleets eastward into the central Med, consolidating my hold on Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis. I will reinforce BOH and GAL defensively to deter German encroachment. I intend to maintain the alliance balance, prevent either England or Germany from soloing, and position myself for a potential late-game push. I will avoid provoking either ally now, but remain vigilant for betrayal opportunities or threats.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1938, I advanced decisively: my fleets repositioned from WES to LYO, TYS to TUN, ION to TYS, ADR to ION, and TRI to ADR, consolidating naval control in the central Med. On land, I took Venice from Italy, reinforced Greece, and solidified my Balkan and Russian holdings. England moved fleets aggressively into NTH, IRI, ENG, MAO, and HEL, while Germany advanced into Belgium and held NWG. France and Italy are effectively eliminated, with their last units about to fall.
Negotiations focused on finalizing the tripartite demarcation: England takes Iberia, Marseilles, Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia; Germany secures Paris, Berlin, Kiel, Denmark, northern France; I consolidate Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Tunis. England repeatedly demanded I cut support from TYS to TUN and withdraw east after supporting his SPA/SC-MAR attack, promising not to push further east. Germany shared detailed moves (BUR-PAR, KIE-SIL, BER-PRU, DEN-BAL) and emphasized coordination to contain England post-France. I promised to cut TYS and WES to ensure England's capture of Marseilles, then withdraw my fleets eastward, reinforcing my sphere and avoiding conflict. Both allies issued strong warnings against betrayal, but no promises were broken this round.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will cut ENG's support from TYS and WES to guarantee his SPA/SC-MAR succeeds, then immediately begin withdrawing my fleets eastward into TYS, ION, and ADR to consolidate Italy and Balkans. On land, I will reinforce BOH and GAL defensively, respecting Germany's northern sphere. I intend to maintain the alliance balance, watch for any English overreach, and be ready to pivot with Germany if England violates the demarcation. My goal is to secure my sphere, prevent an English solo, and position myself for a potential late-game advantage.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1938, I advanced aggressively: took Munich, pushed WAR to PRU, reinforced GAL and BOH, and supported my Balkan holdings. My fleets moved into ADR and ION, and I seized Rome and Marseilles' vicinity. England consolidated naval dominance, moving into NTH and ENG, holding BEL and HOL, and positioning to take Iberia. Germany retreated to PAR and MUN, losing ground but maintaining a defensive posture. Builds followed: I added an army in VIE, England disbanded BEL's fleet, and Germany disbanded NWG's fleet, indicating a focus on land defense.
Negotiations centered on a tripartite demarcation: England takes Iberia, Marseilles, Low Countries, Scandinavia; Germany consolidates PAR, KIE, BER, DEN, SWE; I hold Russia, Balkans, Italy, and Tunis. I promised England to cut German interference and support his attack on MAR, then withdraw my fleets eastward to avoid friction. England confirmed his moves on MAR and BEL, expecting my cooperation. Germany repeatedly warned of England's aggression, shared detailed moves (BUR-PAR, KIE-SIL, BER-PRU, DEN-BAL, RUH-HOL), and sought coordination to quietly prepare a containment front post-France. Both expect me to honor my commitments this turn, with England trusting my naval withdrawal and Germany expecting no betrayal.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will cut any German support or interference from TYS and WES, enabling England's F SPA/SC - MAR to succeed. My fleets will then shift eastward into TYS, ION, and ADR, consolidating my sphere and avoiding conflict with England. On land, I will reinforce BOH, GAL, and the Balkans defensively, watching Germany's moves carefully. I intend to maintain the alliance facade with England while quietly coordinating with Germany to contain English expansion once France is eliminated. I will avoid provoking either power this turn, but prepare diplomatically and positionally for the next phase of rivalry.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1939, I advanced aggressively: captured Berlin with A MUN - BER, pressured Prussia with WAR - PRU, consolidated my Balkan holdings, and moved fleets west—TYS to Naples, LYO and TUN toward Western Med, and ADR into ION. England took Marseilles and reinforced Belgium, while Germany retreated to defensive positions but lost ground. The phase solidified my control over Central and Eastern Europe, while England dominated the western seas.
Throughout negotiations, I reaffirmed support for England's attacks on Naples and Marseilles, promising to cut German support and assist his gains, in exchange for his fleets pivoting west post-Italy and respecting my consolidation of Italy, Balkans, Russia, and Munich. England repeatedly demanded I cut TYS support and move east after France falls, which I confirmed. Germany refused all my ultimatums to cede Munich and Prussia peacefully, insisting on defending them and accusing England of aggression. Despite my threats, GER remains defiant, moving PRU to BER and RUH to MUN. I maintained the tripartite division proposal—ENG takes Iberia, Naples, Marseilles; I take Italy, Balkans, Russia, Munich; GER keeps Berlin, Kiel, Scandinavia—but Germany rejected territorial concessions, and England focused on Iberia and Naples with naval dominance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support England's F SPA/SC - MAR by cutting any German support from TYS and WES, and guarantee his capture of Naples with F ION - NAP supported by F TYS and A APU. Simultaneously, I will press my armies to secure Munich and Prussia despite German resistance, likely ordering BOH S WAR - PRU and BUD S SER, while maintaining Balkan stability. My fleets will begin pivoting east post-Italy as promised, but I will keep a wary eye on England's naval buildup. I intend to crush German resistance swiftly, then reassess whether to confront England's expansion or maintain the balance. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure GER to accept a reduced sphere or face elimination, while holding England to his promise to respect my sphere.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG, GER]: Gentlemen, the only rational path is coordinated elimination of German resistance now.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, England retreated F NAP to ROM, consolidating their hold on Italy. Austria built an army in TRI, reinforcing its central position. The strategic landscape now features Austria dominant in the Balkans, Italy, and Russia, with England entrenched in France, Iberia, and the Low Countries. Germany remains cornered with four centers but is defiant.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated Austro-English assault to crush Germany. I repeatedly proposed to ENG that I attack Munich (A BOH - MUN supported by A VIE - TYR) and Prussia (A BER supports A WAR - PRU), while ENG presses BEL and HOL and moves F SPA/SC - MAR. England confirmed these plans and requested I cut support from TYS to TUN to facilitate their move into MAR. Germany refused all offers to cooperate, instead issuing threats and insisting I focus on England. I maintained pressure on GER, offering survival if he supported me, but he rejected all overtures. England and I reaffirmed our division of spoils: ENG takes Iberia, France, Low Countries; I consolidate Balkans, Italy, Russia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute the planned attacks: A BOH - MUN supported by A VIE - TYR, A BER supports A WAR - PRU, F TYS - ROM with A NAP support to pressure GER's southern flank, and fleets in WES and TUN will cut MAO and NAF to isolate Iberia. This should break German resistance and solidify my sphere. I will honor the division with England for now, but remain vigilant for solo opportunities once GER collapses. I will ignore GER's threats and focus on rapid territorial gains.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1940, I advanced decisively: captured Rome, reinforced Munich with support from Bohemia, and pushed War to Prussia with Berlin's support. My fleets repositioned to North Africa and the Mid-Atlantic, tightening the noose on Iberia. England largely held position but shifted fleets north and west, while Germany retreated from Berlin to Kiel and consolidated in central Europe, losing ground but maintaining a defensive posture.
Throughout negotiations, I coordinated closely with England, agreeing to cut Tunis support with F TYS and isolate Iberia, while England presses Belgium, Holland, and Marseilles. We synchronized plans to crush Germany: my armies will assault Kiel and Silesia, while England seizes German northern holdings. Germany refused all offers of vassalage or cooperation, instead issuing threats and propaganda. England confirmed all moves and support requests, maintaining alliance discipline. No promises were broken; my offers to Germany were rejected outright.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a multi-pronged assault: A BER supports A PRU - SIL, A PRU attacks SIL, A MUN supports A BER - KIE, A BER - KIE, A GAL - WAR, A VIE - BOH, A TYR supports A MUN. My fleets F TYS will cut Tunis, F WES and F NAF will isolate Iberia, and F ION, F ADR maintain southern control. The goal is to eliminate German resistance swiftly, secure central Europe, and prepare for the division of Scandinavia and France with England. I will maintain the alliance with England for now, but remain vigilant for future opportunities to outmaneuver them once Germany falls.</li>
