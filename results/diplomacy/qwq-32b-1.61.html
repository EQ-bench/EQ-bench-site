<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, let's agree: you move west, I secure the Balkans. No conflict in the center. Deal?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am interested in discussing the Balkans. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding Bulgaria and Romania. Perhaps we can coordinate our movements to avoid conflict and maximize our gains in the region. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To all powers, Turkey seeks to maintain peace and stability in the region. I am open to diplomatic discussions and proposals that promote mutual understanding and cooperation. I believe that through open communication, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts and work towards a more prosperous future for all.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, we share a border in Ven and Tri. I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am focused on expansion elsewhere and would prefer not to fight you at this time. What are your intentions in the Adriatic?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we observe your units near Galicia. We propose a discussion regarding our mutual interests in the Balkans. What are your intentions regarding Rumania?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany suggests a period of peaceful co-existence. We have no immediate designs on your territory and believe a stable central Europe benefits us both. Are you amenable to a neutral stance?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, Austria secures RUM and SER. You take BUL. No interference in each other's zones. This ensures mutual expansion. Confirm?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS, your forces remain in GAL. In return, I guarantee no Austrian moves into WAR. Focus on your zone; I take RUM. Mutual respect. Deal?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, your units move west into BOH/MUN. I secure the Balkans. No Austrian moves into your territory. This preserves our central stability. Agreed?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we accept your suggestion for cooperation. We will move to Galicia, and you will focus on Rumania. We expect your full cooperation in securing Rumania for our mutual benefit.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, we appreciate your offer. However, Germany cannot commit to a fixed direction. Our movements will be dictated by the overall situation. We propose a more flexible agreement: Germany will not attack Austria directly, provided Austria does not threaten German interests in Bohemia or Silesia. Is this acceptable?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I propose a division of the Balkans. I am interested in Bulgaria, and you are likely interested in Serbia. Perhaps we can agree to support each other's advances in these regions, ensuring neither of us interferes with the other's expansion. This would prevent a costly war between us and allow us to focus on other threats.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I accept your proposal to avoid conflict. I will take VEN, and you secure RUM and SER. No attacks between us. I propose we support each other in these endeavors. A VEN - TRI, supported by A ROM. Do you agree to support this move?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, TRI is my home SC and non-negotiable. Your A VEN - TRI move directly threatens my core. I propose: You secure VEN and GRE while I take RUM/SER. Redirect your forces southward. Let's formalize this division to avoid conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, I confirm: No Austrian moves into BOH/MUN. In exchange, your units remain west of TYR. Let's formalize this neutrality pact to stabilize the center and focus on mutual expansion.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, confirmed: You take BUL, I secure RUM/SER. We will not contest each other's zones. I will support your advance into BUL while you acknowledge my priority in RUM/SER. Let's proceed with this Balkan division.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we note your guarantee regarding Warsaw. However, our forces remain in Galicia to exert pressure and ensure your compliance with our agreement regarding Rumania. We expect you to move into Rumania immediately.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I need your support for A VEN - TRI. Will you support this move? If so, I will support your moves into RUM and SER in the future. Let me know if you agree to this specific support order.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, your proposal is too restrictive. Germany requires flexibility. We reiterate our offer: Germany will not attack Austria directly, provided Austria does not threaten German interests in Bohemia or Silesia. This is a conditional agreement, not a fixed territorial division. Accept this, or we will consider our options.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I confirm your proposal: you secure Rumania and Serbia, and I take Bulgaria. We agree to no interference in each other's zones. Let us coordinate our movements to ensure a swift and decisive occupation of these territories. I suggest we support each other's moves to prevent any unforeseen complications.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, TRI is my inviolable core. Redirect A VEN to GRE instead. In return, I will not contest GRE or ALB. Secure VEN and GRE while I take RUM/SER. Mutual non-interference in Adriatic is critical. Confirm support for this plan.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS, your forces hold GAL, I secure RUM. I confirm no Austrian moves into WAR. Execute coordinated occupation: your A WAR can support my advance into RUM. Formalize this division to prevent third-party interference.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, proceed to BUL unopposed. I claim RUM/SER exclusively. We will coordinate movements to ensure simultaneous occupation of our agreed zones. Your fleet in ANK can support my push south while I secure my Balkan core. Confirm readiness to execute.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I confirm our agreement. I will take Bulgaria, and you will secure Rumania and Serbia. We will not contest each other's zones. I will move A CON - BUL this turn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we reiterate our expectation that you move into Rumania immediately. Our presence in Galicia is contingent on your full cooperation. Do not test our resolve.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany rejects your attempt to restrict our movements. Our previous offer stands: Germany will not attack Austria directly, provided Austria does not threaten German interests in Bohemia or Silesia. Your insistence on fixed territorial divisions is unacceptable. We will act as we deem necessary to protect our interests.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your refusal to allow me TRI is noted. I will adjust my strategy accordingly. Consider our agreement null and void. I will be expanding where I see fit.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Opening position with all units in home territories; no prior moves executed yet.
Secured Balkan division with TUR (BUL) and RUS (GAL) while Italy's refusal to respect TRI led to pact dissolution. GER rejected fixed territorial limits but agreed to non-aggression under conditions. Key promises: RUS secures GAL, AUT takes RUM/SER, TUR takes BUL. Italy abandoned pact after TRI dispute.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - RUM, A VIE supports RUM occupation; F TRI secures Adriatic by moving to ION or supporting A VIE - SER. Coordinate with RUS via A GAL support, counter-Italy if they violate Adriatic. Maintain GER neutrality via non-interference in BOH. Execute agreed Balkan division with TUR.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Our Balkan pact stands. Secure BUL while I take RUM. I move A BUD - RUM and support your hold on BUL. Coordinate your fleet in BLA to block Italian interference. Your A SMY can pressure GRE to isolate ITA. Reply with your plans for joint action against ITA's Adriatic ambitions.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your seizure of TRI shattered our pact. Withdraw from VEN and ADR immediately or face war. My F ADR will take VEN, and A VIE will strike TYR. Surrender TRI or lose VEN and TYR. Your fleet in ION is vulnerable to my ADR-based forces. Choose wisely.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: GAL is yours; I claim RUM. Do not advance into my territories (SER, TRI) and I will not contest your path to WAR. Your A GAL can support my RUM push if desired. Confirm your non-interference in the Balkans while we neutralize ITA's southern ambitions.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I see your attempt to move to Rumania failed. I will continue to apply pressure from Galicia. I suggest you try again. I will support you if you need it. I will not move into Warsaw.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am willing to reconsider our position if you cede TRI to Italy. This would allow for a more stable and cooperative relationship in the region. What do you say?</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your claim to TRI is invalid. Withdraw from VEN and ADR immediately or face war. My fleet in ADR will seize VEN, and A VIE will strike TYR. Surrender TRI or face coordinated attacks from Austria, Turkey, and Russia.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Our pact holds. I move A BUD - SER, supported by your A BUL. Coordinate your fleet in BLA to block Italy's navy. Let's secure the Balkans as agreed. Split spoils: you take BUL, I take RUM/SER.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, we agree to non-aggression. I will not target BOH, and you stay out of Austrian territories. Focus on France. Let's keep the border quiet. Mutual non-interference ensures our survival.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I appreciate your support for my hold in Bulgaria. I will position my fleet in the Black Sea to deter Italian interference. I agree that my army in Smyrna can exert pressure on Greece. I propose we coordinate our efforts to contain Italy's Adriatic ambitions. What specific moves do you suggest for our joint action against Italy?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are noted. However, I will not be intimidated. My forces are positioned to defend VEN and TYR. Your aggression will only lead to your downfall. I suggest you reconsider your position and focus on your own survival.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I will take GAL. I will not advance into SER or TRI. I will support your RUM push with A GAL. I expect you to focus on ITA and not interfere with my interests in the Black Sea. Confirm your agreement.</li>

<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your occupation of TRI is intolerable. This spring, F ADR will seize VEN, and A VIE will strike TYR. TUR's A SMY can take GRE while RUS's A GAL supports my A BUD - RUM. Your fleet in ION is exposed to coordinated strikes. Surrender TRI or lose VEN, TYR, and your Adriatic footholds permanently.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Move A SMY to GRE and F BLA to ALB to block ITA's retreat. I secure RUM/SER, you take BUL/GRE. Your fleet in BLA can pressure GRE directly. Confirm your A SMY moves to GRE this spring to isolate ITA's navy.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Confirm your A GAL supports my A BUD - RUM. I'll reciprocate by not contesting your path to WAR. Your A GAL's support is critical—coordinate F SEV to pressure RUM alongside us.

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I will support your move to Serbia with my army in Bulgaria. My fleet in the Black Sea is positioned to deter Italian interference. I suggest you focus on securing Rumania and Serbia, while I consolidate my position in Bulgaria and prepare for further expansion into Greece. Let's coordinate our moves to maximize our gains in the Balkans.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are empty. I will not withdraw from VEN or TYR. Your alliance with Russia and Turkey is a desperate attempt to survive. I suggest you focus on defending your own territories, as I am coming for TRI. Prepare for war.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITALY, your defiance ends now. A VIE attacks TYR, F ADR takes VEN. TUR's A SMY secures GRE, cutting your retreat. RUS supports my A BUD into RUM. Your Adriatic ambitions die here. Withdraw from VEN/TY/VEN/TYR or face annihilation. Your fleet in ION is exposed—TUR's F BLA will intercept. Surrender TRI or lose everything south of the Alps.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR, RUS]: TUR, RUS: Execute our pact. TUR: A SMY to GRE, F BLA block ION. RUS: A GAL supports A BUD - RUM. We split Balkan spoils as agreed. Move now to crush ITA's Adriatic ambitions. Confirm support by turn's end.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER: Honor our pact. Stay out of BOH, I won't touch your borders. Focus on FRA. Your non-interference secures our alliance. Let's keep the eastern front stable. I'll target ITA, you handle FRA—mutual survival requires this discipline.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. I will not withdraw from VEN or TYR. Your alliance with Russia and Turkey is a desperate attempt to survive. I suggest you focus on defending your own territories, as I am coming for TRI. Prepare for war.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I will move A SMY to GRE as you requested. However, I will not move F BLA to ALB. I need it to maintain control of the Black Sea and deter Russian aggression. I will support your moves in Rumania and Serbia, but I must prioritize my own security. I expect you to honor our agreement and secure Rumania and Serbia. I will take Greece.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am moving A GAL to GAL. I expect you to move A BUD to RUM. I will not support you. I am taking GAL. Do not interfere with my interests in the Black Sea.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1901M, ITA betrayed the Balkan pact by seizing TRI, while RUS captured GAL (an AUT home SC) and blocked my A BUD's RUM advance. TUR honored BUL but failed to fully counter ITA's Adriatic expansion. ITA's fleet in ION and army in TYR/VEN remain threats.
Failed to coerce ITA into retreating; they doubled down on aggression. RUS broke their support pact by seizing GAL, then reneged on RUM support. TUR partially cooperated (A SMY-GREECE, F BLA holding), but refused to fully block ITA's naval routes. GER remained neutral as agreed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. A VIE - TYR to crush ITA's northern army. 2. F ADR - VEN to reclaim lost territory and isolate ITA's VEN army. 3. A BUD supports F ADR's VEN move to ensure capture. 4. Pressure TUR to F BLA - ALB to cut ITA's retreats. 5. Declare open war on ITA, prioritize destroying their Adriatic forces.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am concerned about Italy's growing influence in the Adriatic. I intend to move my army in Smyrna to Armenia to secure my border. I will need to secure Greece to ensure my control of the Aegean. I expect your support in this endeavor, as it will ultimately benefit both our nations by containing Italian expansion.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Tsar, despite prior issues, Italy's Adriatic expansion must be stopped. If your forces in RUM support our push on TRI, we can split their holdings. Let us coordinate to eliminate this threat.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I reiterate my concern about Galicia. I am moving A UKR to SEV to secure my border. I advise you to focus on Italy and refrain from any actions that could destabilize the Balkans. I will not tolerate any aggression towards RUM.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are empty. I will not surrender. Prepare to face the might of Italy and France. Your aggression will be your downfall. I will take VIE and BUD.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I cannot move my fleet to Albania at this time. It is crucial for maintaining control of the Black Sea and deterring Russian aggression.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT to ITA: Your Adriatic ambitions end now. A TYR and F ADR will seize TRI and VEN. TUR's F BLA will block your southern retreat. Surrender those SCs or face annihilation. We'll split the Adriatic: TRI/VEN to AUT, GRE to TUR. Resistance guarantees your destruction.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: AUT to TUR: Move F BLA - ALB immediately. In exchange, we guarantee TUR control of GRE and ALB. Without ALB, ITA's armies escape. Your move to ARM weakens your Adriatic position. Act now to secure the south, and we'll respect your BUL and GRE claims.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: AUT to GER: Your army in BOH violates our prior pact. Withdraw or face support for FRA's advances. We'll back ENG's naval moves if you persist. Your presence in BOH invites French counterattacks. Retreat to MUN or risk losing MUN itself.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I understand your urgency, but moving my fleet to Albania would leave the Black Sea vulnerable to Russia. I cannot risk that.

I expect you to honor our agreement regarding Greece.</li>

I advise you to reconsider your aggressive stance towards Italy and focus on defending your own territories. I will not tolerate any further aggression towards RUM.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To AUT: Your threats are noted. My move to BOH is a direct response to your aggressive posturing. I am willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution, but only if you cease your threats and withdraw your forces from my borders. Otherwise, I will be forced to take further action to protect German interests.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT attacked ITA in the Adriatic (A TYR and F ADR targeting TRI/VEN), but TUR refused to block ITA's retreat routes (choosing to focus on ARM/SYR instead). GER advanced into BOH, while RUS consolidated in RUM/GAL. ITA resisted fiercely, vowing to attack AUT's home SCs.
AUT demanded TUR block ITA's retreat (unsuccessful), threatened GER over BOH occupation, and rebuffed RUS's Balkan warnings. ITA rejected all terms, escalating hostilities. TUR's refusal to aid the Adriatic campaign broke coordination. GER's defiance solidified hostility.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture TRI/VEN via F ADR - VEN and A TYR support, counter GER's BOH incursion with naval support for ENG/FRA, pressure TUR to secure GRE/ALB, and isolate RUS from Adriatic operations. Threaten RUS with GER support if they interfere.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1902M, AUT attacked TRI via A TYR supported by F ADR, while ITA held VEN/TRI. TUR advanced on RUM, RUS moved into GAL/UKR, and GER occupied BOH. TUR/ITA/RUS all made conflicting demands, while ENG/FRA refused to engage against GER. RUS's A GAL - BUD threatens AUT's core.
AUT failed to secure ENG/FRA support against GER but finalized a Balkan pact with TUR (GRE ceded) to isolate ITA. ITA defiantly refused concessions and threatened retaliation. TUR demanded immediate GRE cession and refused Adriatic naval support but agreed to support Serbia. RUS ambiguously proposed Adriatic cooperation while attacking BUD directly.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture VEN/TRI via A TRI - VEN supported by F ADR; coordinate with TUR to trap ITA's ION fleet. Counter RUS's BUD attack with A TRI's remnants if possible. Pressure FRA/ENG to contain GER's BOH advance. Maintain TUR alliance via GRE cession while preparing for potential RUS invasion.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1902M, AUT advanced on VEN with TRI and ADR support while TUR secured GRE. RUS moved into BUL despite truce talks, and ITA resisted with APU and ION. GER pushed into BOH, while ENG/FRA focused on naval positioning. W1902A saw AUT build no units, maintaining pressure on ITA and TUR's Balkan gains.
AUT-TUR alliance frayed as TUR refused to block ITA's retreat routes despite AUT ceding GRE. RUS defied truce demands by reinforcing BUL. ITA rejected all surrender terms, doubling down on resistance. ENG/FRA showed limited Balkan cooperation but prioritized own interests. AUT's demands for TUR's ALB move went unmet, straining trust.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture VEN via TRI/ADR support, secure GRE by backing TUR's hold, annihilate ITA's land units via VEN-TRI axis, and flank GER via VIE-TYR.

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> ITA attacked AUT's VEN and TRI, while RUS advanced into BUL. AUT's units (F ADR, A VEN, A BUD) positioned to counter ITA's incursions. ENG and FRA maintained naval presence in NTH/BEL/WES, while GER consolidated in central Europe.
Failed to secure ITA's withdrawal; ITA defiantly threatened AUT's core. TUR refused to fully cooperate, prioritizing own Balkan interests. Attempted to redirect RUS away from BUL and coordinate with ENG/FRA naval blockades, but TUR's reluctance and ITA's hostility solidified adversarial stances.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Capture VEN/TRI via A VEN and A BUD's advances. Coordinate with ENG/FRA to isolate ITA's ION fleet. Neutralize ITA's land forces in APU/APU. Threaten RUS's BUL advance via TUR cooperation. Deceive TUR by feigning Balkan truce while pressuring their southern flank.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: AUT to TUR: Secure the Balkans via division: I take Serbia (SER), your SC), you secure Albania (ALB). Support my A BUD - SER, and I'll back your A ALB - GRE. Coordinate to isolate ITA's Adriatic holdings. My F ADR can support your ALB advance while targeting VEN.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, FRA]: AUT to ENG/FRA: GER's BOH occupation must be reversed. I'll move APU to VEN, supported by F ADR. Pressure GER's northern borders (e.g., ENG's navy blockades their coast). Coordinate to isolate BOH and cripple their position.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: AUT to RUS: Truce in the Balkans: You keep RUM, I take Serbia. Focus on ITA's Adriatic threat. Your A RUM stays, but don't advance further south. Let's avoid conflict here—your move into GAL was a mistake, but we can coexist if you stay out.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am disappointed in your continued aggression in the Adriatic. I will not support your expansion there. My moves this turn are defensive, focused on consolidating my position in the Balkans. Do not expect any assistance from me against Italy.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To Austria, I propose a ceasefire. Let's discuss a peaceful resolution to our conflict. I am willing to negotiate terms that ensure the stability of the region. What are your demands?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, GER has betrayed us both. They are expanding aggressively into MOS and Scandinavia. I propose a temporary alliance to contain GER's expansion. I am willing to offer support in GAL if you agree to focus your efforts on containing GER in BOH. Let me know if you are interested in coordinating against this common threat.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your ceasefire offer is a ruse. AUT will seize VEN this turn via A APU supported by F ADR. Withdraw your forces or face annihilation. Your Adriatic ambitions end here. Respond with withdrawal terms or prepare for war.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I accept your GER-focused alliance. In return, you must abandon RUM and withdraw from GAL. Let GER's northern front be our shared priority—your A RUM must not oppose my advance into SER. Coordinate your A MOS forces to pressure GER's flank while I secure the Balkan gateway.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, FRA]: GER's seizure of BOH must be reversed. I move A VIE to BOH, supported by F ADR's naval pressure on GER's flank. ENG's navy can blockade KIE, while FRA's armies isolate RUH. Act now—GER's collapse creates opportunities for all.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, your offer of a truce in the Balkans is tempting, but insufficient. I will not abandon my interests in RUM. However, I am willing to coordinate with you against GER. I propose a joint operation to retake MOS. If you agree to support my efforts in MOS, I will consider a temporary truce in the Balkans. Let me know your thoughts.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To AUT, while I appreciate your concerns regarding GER, my current focus remains on FRA. I am unwilling to commit naval resources to the Adriatic at this time. Perhaps we can revisit this matter in the future, should circumstances change.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, a ceasefire is in your best interest. I propose we discuss a division of influence in the Adriatic. I am willing to cede TRI in exchange for VEN and APU. This would create a buffer zone and prevent further bloodshed. Is this acceptable?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS: GER's collapse is our shared priority. I'll support your A MOS advance if you withdraw from RUM and allow my A BUD - SER. Refuse, and I'll ally with GER to crush your Balkan ambitions. Choose now - GER's flank is exposed.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA: Your 'ceasefire' is a trap. AUT's A APU takes VEN (supported by F ADR), A BUD secures SER, and TUR advances on GRE/ALB. Your ION fleet is isolated. Surrender VEN/APU now or face annihilation. Your armies in VEN/APU will be surrounded by land/sea.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT's armies are advancing. A APU and F ADR take VEN this turn. Your fleet in ION is isolated. Surrender VEN/APU or face annihilation. Your armies in VEN/APU cannot hold against our coordinated land/sea assault. Resistance is futile.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I take SER as agreed. In exchange, I'll cede GRE/ALB to you. Your A ALB can secure GRE unopposed. Don't oppose my A BUD - SER, or I'll retaliate in ALB. Focus on FRA/ENG while we crush GER together.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous moves, ITA resisted AUT's demands, TUR rejected Balkan cooperation, and RUS agreed to an alliance against GER. AUT's units (F ADR, A BUD, A APU) positioned for Adriatic expansion, while RUS committed to joint GER attacks. ITA escalated threats, moving towards APU, and TUR focused on Balkan consolidation.
Failed to secure TUR cooperation in the Adriatic; TUR insists on unilateral Balkan control. ITA rejected ceasefire terms, escalating hostilities. Secured RUS alliance via mutual GER-focused coordination: RUS withdraws from GAL, AUT supports RUS's MOS recapture. ENG/FRA remained uncooperative, prioritizing own agendas.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A APU - VEN (supp by F ADR), A BUD - SER. Coordinate with RUS to attack GER's MOS/KIE. Deceive ITA by masking full Balkan coordination with TUR while pressuring their Adriatic holdings. Exploit RUS's northern push to weaken GER, then pivot to secure Adriatic dominance. Maintain plausible deniability in TUR relations while advancing.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1905M, ITA advanced into VIE and BUD, threatening AUT's core. RUS and AUT coordinated against ITA/GER, but TUR consolidated in BUL/RUM. ENG focused on NWG/NTH, while FRA and GER engaged in central Europe. ITA's APU/APU units pressured VEN, and TUR resisted AUT's demands in GRE/ALB.
AUT solidified its RUS alliance, securing support for reclaiming VIE via A GAL. Failed to deter ITA/TUR; ITA rejected all terms and threatened VEN. Secured ENG's neutrality in Balkans in exchange for non-interference in FRA/ENG conflicts. RUS demanded explicit support for WAR/MOS in return for VIE support.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A GAL - VIE via RUS A RUM support. F ADR supports A GAL's push. A VEN holds to counter ITA's APU. Coordinate with RUS to pressure GER via WAR. Block ITA's ION fleet with F ADR. Maintain ENG neutrality via strict adherence to terms. Deceive TUR by feigning Balkan division offers while preparing joint RUS-AUT thrust.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1906M, AUT advanced to reclaim APU and VIE, clashing with ITA over BUD. RUS supported AUT's BUD push but prioritized GER. TUR expanded into SEV and BUL, while ENG/FRA focused on Western conflicts. ITA defied demands to withdraw from BUD/VEN, escalating hostilities.
AUT forged a fragile alliance with RUS to target ITA's BUD, but RUS prioritized GER. ITA rejected all terms, doubling down on aggression. TUR dismissed AUT's demands, escalating Balkan tensions. ENG/FRA remained neutral, refusing Adriatic coordination despite AUT's offers.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. Execute coordinated RUS-AUT assault on ITA's BUD via A VIE + RUS A UKR support. 2. Use F ADR to sever ITA's Adriatic supply lines, targeting ION. 3. Pressure ITA's VEN via A APU, leveraging RUS support in the east. 4. Feign openness to ENG/FRA alliances to isolate ITA, while secretly prioritizing BUD recapture.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, I propose a temporary Adriatic truce. Withdraw from BUD and VEN, and we can divide the Balkans equitably. Refusal will trigger a RUS-AUT alliance's full fury. Your fleet in ION is vulnerable to our combined naval pressure.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1906M, AUT failed to coordinate a joint strike on ITA's BUD due to RUS's refusal to prioritize the attack over reclaiming WAR. ITA defiantly reinforced BUD and threatened AUT's homeland. ENG/FRA remained focused on Western conflicts, while TUR expanded into SEV/ARM.
RUS abandoned the BUD plan to focus on WAR, breaking the alliance. ITA rejected all truces and declared war on AUT. ENG/FRA declined Mediterranean coordination, while TUR escalated Balkan aggression. AUT's overtures collapsed into mutual hostility with RUS and ITA.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A GAL - BUD supported by F ADR to seize ITA's key center despite RUS's betrayal. F ADR will also challenge ITA's ION fleet if possible. Prepare for ITA's TRI invasion by fortifying VIE/TRI. Declare open war on ITA/RUS if necessary.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, Italy maintained control of BUD and VEN while resisting Austrian pressure. Russia coordinated support for Austria's A VIE - BUD via A UKR, while Turkey rejected Balkan cooperation and focused on SEV. France and England remained focused on Western conflicts, ignoring Austrian appeals for naval coordination.
Austria secured a fragile alliance with Russia for a coordinated strike on Italy's BUD, but failed to sway Turkey, Italy, France, or England. Italy defiantly rejected all terms, while Turkey doubled down on independent Balkan ambitions. France and England refused to engage in Balkan coordination despite Austrian entreaties.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strike: A VIE - BUD with Russian A UKR support, F ADR supports this offensive. Simultaneously pressure Italy's Adriatic via F ADR challenging MAO/MAO area. Deceive Turkey by maintaining nominal neutrality while enabling Russian pressure on SEV. Prepare A VIE to pivot to defend VIE/TRI if Italy counterattacks.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1907M, ITA failed to retain BUD as AUT's A VIE recaptured it. TUR consolidated in the Balkans (A RUM, A ARM, A SEV), F ANK). RUS focused on SEV/WAR. ENG contained FRA in the west. ITA remains entrenched in TRI/NAP, threatening the Adriatic. Recent moves show RUS prioritizing WAR over Balkan coordination.
Failed to secure RUS cooperation for Balkan strikes; RUS insists on WAR focus. ITA defiantly refuses withdrawals, escalating hostilities. ENG refuses Balkan involvement. TUR dismisses entreaties, reinforcing Balkan claims.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - TRI (supported by F ADR) to dislodge ITA's Adriatic foothold. If possible, coordinate minimal RUS support against SEV/RUM. Avoid overextension while pressuring ITA's TRI. Prioritize Adriatic control over RUS's WAR ambitions.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Italy occupiesied TRI and VEN, triggering Austrian retreats. Russia and Germany clashed over WAR, while Turkey advanced on BUD and RUM. England consolidated in the North Sea, France held in Western Europe.
Austria attempted to forge anti-Italy alliances with Russia (via coordinated attacks on GER/ITA) and Turkey (GRE concession for Adriatic support). Failed to secure full commitments: Russia demanded mutual support for WAR/VEN strikes, Turkey refused to attack ITA without more concessions. Italy rejected all terms, declaring war. England offered limited naval support for Adriatic defense in exchange for VIE resources.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A TRI - VEN via F ADR support. Coordinate F ADR to assist Russia's A UKR - WAR. Deceive ITA by feigning continued Turkish cooperation while prioritizing VEN recovery. Hold F ADR to pressure ITA's Adriatic fleet. Secretly signal to TUR to focus on GRE while奥地利 focuses on VEN.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1908M, AUT captured VEN via A TRI-VEN, but faced aggression from ITA (threats to seize VEN/TRI) and TUR (advancing on BUD/RUM). RUS demanded support for A MOS-WAR, which AUT refused, leading to alliance strain. GER's collapse began with ENG's naval dominance (controlling NTH/DEN/STP). ITA expanded to TUS/PIC, while RUS and TUR consolidated in the Balkans.
AUT forged an alliance with ENG for Adriatic naval support (in exchange for VIE resources), but failed to secure RUS's backing due to conflicting demands. ITA rejected all truces and declared war, while TUR ignored AUT's Balkan proposals. AUT deceived GER by feigning alliance to mislead their strategy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Move A VEN - TRI to seize the lynchpin, coordinate with ENG's NTH/DWG fleets to blockade ITA's Adriatic access. Deceive GER by signaling support to mislead their response. Prioritize crippling ITA's fleet via joint ENG/AUT pressure while avoiding direct conflict with TUR until RUM is secured. Hold F ADR to challenge ITA's MAO/ROM positions.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria coordinated with England to plan a joint assault on Italy's VIE, with England committing naval support. Turkey resisted Balkan concessions but adjusted some moves, while Italy refused all terms and prepared counterattacks.
Solidified England's naval support for VIE capture, secured partial Turkish concessions (A SER to BUL), but Italy remained defiant. Promises: ENG's F SKA blockaded ITA's supply lines, AUT granted ENG access to VIE's resources post-capture. TUR's partial compliance reduced direct Balkan conflict but did not fully resolve tensions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A TRI - VIE to reclaim the SC, supported by ENG's naval blockades (F EDI to ION, F SKA cutting supply lines). Monitor TUR's BUL movements and prepare for ITA's Adriatic counterattacks. Maintain pressure on ITA via ENG's naval dominance.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1910M, AUT consolidated in VIE after losing all other units. ITA advanced into MUN and TYS, TUR seized BUL/ALB and reinforced SEV, while RUS pushed into WAR. ENG blockaded the North Sea, and FRA contested BEL/MAR. Key failures included failed truces with ITA/TUR and RUS's refusal to support BUD without AUT's prior support for WAR.
AUT failed to secure RUS's BUD support despite supporting for WAR, faced ITA/TUR's outright hostility, and finalized ENG naval coordination against ITA. Broken promises: RUS withheld BUD support despite AUT's compliance. Promises kept: ENG's ION blockade and MAR recognition. Deception: AUT's veiled threat to RUS about redirecting forces to TUR's border pressured RUS to at least support WAR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A VIE - BUD to contest TUR's Balkan hold, coordinate with ENG's F EDI blockading ITA's supply lines, and exploit RUS's WAR advance to isolate GER. Publicly feign continued alliance with ENG while secretly signaling to RUS that BUD success hinges on their support. Hold to MAR promise to ENG but prioritize BUD over TYS/PIE. Deceive TUR by feigning weakness to lure them into overextending in ALB/GRE.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1911M, Austria advanced A VIE toward BUD while coordinating with ENG's naval blockades against ITA. TUR moved into GRE/ALB per prior agreements, while ITA rejected truce offers and threatened VIE. RUS maintained defensive postures, and ENG's fleets targeted ITA's Adriatic supply lines.
Austria secured ENG naval support (F EDI-ADR) for the BUD push but failed to broker a truce with ITA, which doubled down on aggression. TUR affirmed partial Balkan cooperation but prioritized own territorial gains. Russia's warnings were ignored as Austria focused on Balkan dominance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Move A VIE - BUD to secure the Balkans, coordinate with ENG's F EDI to blockade ITA's Adriatic access, and exploit TUR's pressure on ITA's southern flank. Maintain pressure on ITA via threats to their Adriatic holdings while leveraging ENG's naval superiority.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, AUT coordinated with ENG and RUS to pressure ITA over VIE, while TUR advanced into GRE/SER. ITA refused to withdraw from VIE, leading to escalating hostilities. RUS agreed to support AUT's VIE recapture in exchange for support against GER, while ENG committed naval blockades. TUR expressed distrust over AUT's promise to cede GRE post-victory.
AUT solidified naval coordination with ENG to isolate ITA's Adriatic holdings, secured RUS's alliance against GER via mutual support, and reaffirmed (deceptively) GRE cession to TUR to maintain Balkan neutrality. ITA rejected all truces, doubling down on VIE. TUR detected AUT's manipulative tactics, downgrading trust. Broken promises: AUT's GRE pledge to TUR is likely insincere.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - VIE to reclaim capital; F TRI to ALB to trap ITA's southern forces. Coordinate with ENG's F EDI/NAO blockades and RUS's A MOS pressure on WAR. Deceive TUR by pretending to honor GRE cession while retaining it post-victory. Neutralize ITA via combined land/sea assault. Avoid TUR entanglements beyond Balkan agreements.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1912M, Austria attempted to coordinate with Russia and England against Italy and Germany, but Turkey rejected the cession of Greece and advanced into RUM and GRE. Russia prioritized attacking Germany over aiding against Turkey, while England agreed to naval support contingent on resource concessions. Italy remained hostile, refusing to withdraw from Venice.
Austria proposed alliances to isolate Italy, cede Greece to Turkey, and coordinate with Russia/England. Turkey distrusted the offer, demanding guarantees, then rejected the deal and advanced aggressively. Russia agreed to attack Germany but refused to block Turkey. England complied with naval support but demanded post-victory concessions. Italy remained defiant, vowing to attack Austria directly.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strike: A VIE supports RUS's A MOS - WAR via F TRI's support. F TRI moves to ALB to block ITA's Adriatic retreats. Coordinate with ENG's blockade (F MAO/EDI to ION/ALB). Counter ITA's advance on TRI/VEN. Maintain pressure on GER while defending against TUR's Balkan moves. Prioritize securing BUD and VIE against ITA's threats.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In prior moves, Austria advanced A BUD toward VIE, coordinating with England's naval blockades and Russia's eastern push against Germany. Italy resisted fiercely, refusing to abandon VIE, while Turkey remained hostile but non-interfering.
Secured England's naval support via F MAO to ADR and F NAO to MAO to block Italy's Adriatic retreats. Russia agreed to support Austria's VIE assault in exchange for backing their WAR push. Italy defiantly refused to withdraw, escalating tensions. Turkey rejected prior truce terms, maintaining hostile stance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strike: A BUD - VIE, F TRI - ALB to trap ITA's fleet. Coordinate with ENG's F MAO to ADR and F NAO to MAO. Support RUS's A MOS - WAR via A BUD's advance. Deceive ITA by feigning weakness until ENG's fleets are in position.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In prior moves, AUT attempted to secure BUD with RUS support while facing ITA's threat to TYR and TUR's expansion into BUL/SER. ENG and FRA coordinated Adriatic blockades, while GER and RUS clashed over WAR/MOS. TUR's advances in the Balkans and ITA's aggression necessitate decisive coordination with ENG/RUS.
ENG demanded confirmation of AUT's BUD commitment to justify Adriatic blockades. RUS insisted on synchronized support for WAR/BUD, while TUR rejected truce offers and reinforced BUL/SER. ITA declared war, targeting TYR. Deception maintained with TUR via false truce talks to mask countermeasures.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A VIE-BUD via RUS support, F TRI to ALB to trap ITA's fleet and block TUR's GRE-ALB advance. Coordinate ENG's F MAO/NAO to sever ITA supply lines. Deceive TUR by maintaining truce pretense while reinforcing GAL/ADR to counter their BUL/SER push. Pressure GER via RUS collaboration.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1913M, AUT shifted forces toward BUD, while ENG and RUS coordinated attacks on ITA and GER. RUS advanced on UKR, and TUR resisted Balkan pressure. W1913A saw RUS commit A WAR to UKR, ENG reinforced northern fleets, and ITA entrenched in Adriatic. TUR demanded territorial concessions but faced AUT's refusal.
Secured ENG naval coordination (F NAO-MAO, F PIC-ION) and RUS support (A UKR backing A BUD-VIE) in exchange for backing RUS's WAR advance. TUR's demand for TRI/VIE was rejected, solidifying hostility. Promised VEN/ALB to TUR post-victory but refused territorial giveaways.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A BUD - VIE supported by F TRI, coordinate with ENG's Adriatic blockade and RUS's UKR pressure. Deceive TUR by refusing their territorial demands while focusing on crushing ITA. Hold F TRI stationary to reinforce VIE assault, deny ITA supply lines. If RUS fulfills support, proceed to secure VIE and pressure ITA's flank.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1914M, AUT advanced A BUD to VIE with RUS's A UKR support, while ENG's fleets moved to pressure ITA. ITA resisted with A TYR to VIE and naval presence, TUR pushed into SER. RUS pressured GER via A STP-NWY and A WAR-LVN.
AUT secured RUS support for VIE via A UKR, coordinating with ENG's naval blockades. Rejected ITA's truce offer, maintaining hostile stance. Promised RUS mutual support against GER, but ITA refused to back down, escalating Adriatic conflict.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Move A BUD - VIE (RUS-supported), F TRI - VEN. Coordinate ENG's F NAO-MAAO to isolate ITA. Support RUS's A WAR-LVN via non-interference. Counter TUR's A BUL-SER via diplomatic pressure or defensive support from VEN. Maintain hostile posture against ITA/TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1915M, TUR captured BUD and TRI, threatening AUT's core. RUS and ENG provided partial support: RUS's A GAL supported AUT's BUD assault, while ENG's fleets positioned to block ITA. ITA advanced on VIE, and GER held in the east. AUT's A VIE and F TRI remain critical to reclaiming territory.
AUT leveraged ENG naval power to isolate TUR/ITA, promised support for RUS's GER-focused offensives in exchange for BUD support, and failed to negotiate with TUR/ITA. ENG/RUS confirmed coordination but RUS prioritized GER over ITA. TUR/ITA rejected all terms, escalating hostilities.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A VIE will attack BUD supported by RUS A GAL; F TRI takes VEN to counter ITA's Adriatic ambitions. Coordinate with ENG's F NAO/NAO to blockade TUR supply lines. Deceive TUR by feigning truce talks while mobilizing ENG/RUS forces. Prioritize reclaiming BUD/TRI, then pivot to neutralize ITA's Adriatic fleet.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1916M, AUT's A VIE-BUD succeeded with RUS support, but ITA and TUR launched direct assaults on TRI/BUD. ENG's fleets blockaded Scandinavia, while FRA advanced into northern Europe. TUR's forces pressured SEV and BUD, and ITA's armies threatened VIE/TRI.
AUT brokered fragile alliances with ENG/RUS to counter ITA/TUR's invasions, but ITA/TUR refused truces and escalated threats. RUS demanded strict coordination (e.g., F TRI supporting A WAR-LVN), while ENG prioritized Adriatic control. AUT balanced promises of resource-sharing with deception to delay ITA's advance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Hold BUD with RUS support, execute F TRI-VEN to trap ITA's fleet, and coordinate with ENG's F NAO-ADR to isolate ITA. Deceive ITA by feigning truce talks while reinforcing defenses. Pressure TUR via RUS's eastern front and ENG's naval blockade. Prioritize survival and reclaiming lost influence in the Balkans.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1916M, AUT attempted to coordinate with RUS to attack BUD and with ENG to block ITA, but TUR's failed VIE attack and ITA's hostile advances created tension. RUS demanded F TRI support their LVN offensive, while ENG pressured AUT to secure VEN and MAO post-victory. TUR and ITA refused truces, escalating hostilities.
AUT juggled conflicting demands: RUS insisted F TRI support their LVN move, while ENG demanded F TRI secure VEN. AUT made deceptive assurances to RUS while prioritizing ENG's Adriatic strategy. ITA and TUR rejected truces, doubling down on aggression. RUS's ultimatum to F TRI to support LVN was ignored in favor of ENG's naval blockade plan.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> F TRI will move to VEN to block ITA's Adriatic retreats, fulfilling ENG's demands. A VIE will attack BUD again, but without RUS support. Deceptively delay RUS with false promises while prioritizing ENG's naval blockade. This will betray RUS's demands, likely triggering hostility. Hold F TRI in VEN to cripple ITA's supply lines.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria's A VIE - BUD attack failed, leaving it vulnerable. ITA advanced into TYR and APU, RUS pushed into GAL/UKR, and TUR consolidated in SEV/CON. ENG and FRA coordinated northern blockades, while GER held central Europe.
Broke RUS's explicit order to support A LVN - WAR by redirecting F TRI to VEN, triggering RUS's hostility. Maintained fragile ENG alliance via VEN concessions but failed to deter TUR's territorial demands. ITA rejected all truce offers, escalating Adriatic conflict.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Prioritize ENG alliance by securing VEN for them while confronting RUS openly. A VIE will support F ENG's Adriatic blockade, while F TRI holds VEN as promised. Deceive TUR by feigning Balkan truce talks while preparing to counterattack ITA's southern flank. Declare open war on RUS for broken trust.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1917M, AUT's attempt to coordinate with ENG against ITA and TUR faltered: A VIE's attack on BUD likely failed due to TUR resistance, while ENG's naval support for AUT was conditional and self-serving. TUR and ITA pressed aggressively, with TUR occupying BUD and ITA advancing on TRI. RUS abandoned AUT entirely.
ENG betrayed the prior agreement by refusing to support A VIE-BUD and reneging on VEN cession, instead demanding MAO and VEN post-victory. TUR and ITA rejected all truces, with TUR advancing on VIE and ITA targeting TRI. AUT's deception efforts (e.g., feigning joint ITA-TUR assaults) failed to secure reliable alliances.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A VIE holds to defend against TUR's BUD army; F TRI advances to VEN to seize the SC before ENG/ITA. Secretly coordinate with ENG to weaken ITA's Adriatic fleet while preparing to betray ENG post-ITA collapse. Feign cooperation with TUR by offering BUD/RUM concessions to delay their advance.</li>

<li><i>Intent:</i> F TRI will convoy to VEN via ENG's support, fulfilling the deal's surface terms while retaining hostile stance. A VIE will support F TRI's capture of VEN. Deceive ENG by maintaining public hostility while collaborating. Feign openness with TUR to delay their advance, preserving A VIE to contest BUD if TUR overextends.

AUT brokered a fragile alliance with ENG (ceding VEN/MAO post-victory for naval support) while attempting to deceive TUR with territorial concessions.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1919M, AUT coordinated with ENG/FRA to attack ITA's Adriatic holdings, capturing TRI via A BUD-TRI. TUR advanced into BUD and pressured GRE/ALB, while RUS severed ties entirely. ITA resisted truce offers and escalated aggression toward AUT's core territories.
Failed to secure TUR's withdrawal from BUD despite offering TRI, while solidifying ENG coordination to dismantle ITA's Adriatic presence. ITA and RUS remained hostile; TUR demanded AUT's core territories. Deceptive offers to TUR/ITA to stall aggression while prioritizing ENG collaboration.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strike: A TRI-MAR (supp by F VEN) to cripple ITA's MAR SC. Hold VIE against TUR's threats, support ENG's naval dominance via F VEN. Deceive TUR by maintaining truce pretenses while focusing on ITA's collapse. Avoid RUS entanglements.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In prior moves, Austria coordinated with England to plan a joint Adriatic assault on Italy, with England agreeing to block Italian naval supply lines via F NAO to ADR. Italy rejected all truce offers and advanced on TRI, while Turkey refused Austria's territorial concessions and pushed into GRE/RUM. Russia maintained hostility, targeting SEV/BUL.
Austria finalized plans with England to split MAR/APU post-victory, while attempting to deceive Turkey into halting advances via false concessions. Promises included ceding BUD/RUM to Turkey and a 50/50 MAR/APU split with England. Italy and Turkey rebuffed all agreements, Italy advancing on TRI and Turkey into the Balkans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strike: A TRI-MAR via convoy from F VEN, supported by A BUD. A VIE holds to counter Russia's advance. Deceive Turkey by feigning BUD/RUM cession while England's F NAO blocks ION. Maintain hostile stance against Italy/Russia/Turkey while exploiting ENG alliance. Secretly prepare A BUD to support TRI's MAR push instead of aiding Turkey.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1920M, ENG advanced fleets toward ITA's Adriatic holdings, FRA attacked GER's territories, and TUR pushed into RUM and SER. In W1920A, ENG built a fleet in NWY, GER built an army in BER, and ITA consolidated in TRI. TUR continued pressure on BUL and BUD, while RUS advanced into UKR. Recent moves set the stage for a critical confrontation over TRI, VEN, and BUD.
Failed to secure TUR's truce despite ceding BUD/RUM; ITA refused to withdraw from VEN/TRI. ENG-_AUT coordination faltered over resource splits (VEN/MAO) but remained aligned on targeting ITA. RUS and TUR maintained hostile posturing. Final agreements: AUT commits to A VIE-TRI supported by A BUD, with ENG blockading ITA's ION/ADR. TUR's demands for VIE/TRI remain unmet, escalating tensions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strike: A VIE - TRI via A BUD support, F VEN supports naval blockade of ITA's Adriatic supply lines. Cede BUD to TUR by not defending it, focusing on eliminating ITA's Adriatic presence first. If ENG honors the VEN/MAO split, hold to agreement; if not, pivot to TUR alignment. A BUD will prioritize TRI over BUD defense per prior deals.</li>

ENG's F MAO and F NTH positioned for Adriatic control, but ITA's fleet in ION/ADR remained a threat.
AUT aggressively coordinated with ENG to isolate ITA's Adriatic fleet and secure VIE, promising MAR/APU division post-victory. ITA and TUR rejected all truces, doubling down on hostile advances. ENG complied with naval coordination but RUS and TUR remained implacable. AUT maintained hostile relations with ITA/RUS/TUR despite desperate diplomacy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute joint ENG/AUT strike: A TRI - VIE supported by A BUD, F VEN to ADR to trap ITA's fleet with ENG's F MAO. Simultaneously, pressure TUR's flank via SEV/RUM to divert their attacks. Prioritize crippling ITA's Adriatic SCs while holding VIE against ITA's counterattacks.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: ENG, execute F MAO to ION to sever ITA's Adriatic supply. A BUD - VIE is supported by A TRI—your fleets must block ITA's retreat routes. VEN and MAR are secured to you post-victory. Delay means ITA's collapse slips through your inaction.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, I propose a last-ditch truce: I'll recognize your hold on VIE if you withdraw from APU and TYS. Refusal means joint ENG/AUT assault. Your fleet in ION is isolated—surrender or be crushed.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, I'll cede BUD and RUM immediately if you redirect forces to SEV. Let's ally against ITA's Adriatic threat. Post-victory, the Balkans are yours—cease BUD attacks and I'll grant RUM now. Your move.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I have executed the naval support for your VIE assault. F MAO is moving to ION. A BUD to VIE supported by A TRI is confirmed. I expect VEN and MAR post-victory. Ensure VIE falls this turn. I will move F MAO to POR.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your demise is imminent. VIE and TRI are mine. There will be no peace, only conquest. I am moving A VIE to BUD. Prepare to be annexed.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your desperation is pathetic. I will not be swayed by your empty promises. Your empire is doomed, and I will personally ensure its destruction. There will be no truce, no alliance, and no mercy. Prepare to be crushed. Your time is over.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1922M, Austria coordinated with ENG to assault ITA's VIE, but ITA counterattacked BUD while TUR and RUS maintained pressure. ENG complied with naval support, but ITA/RUS/TUR rejected truces, leaving AUT isolated and BUD vulnerable.
Austria secured ENG's naval support for the VIE offensive but failed to deter ITA's BUD assault. TUR and RUS rebuffed all overtures, reinforcing their hostile stance. ITA rejected concessions and escalated aggression, while ENG demanded territorial concessions post-victory.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated assault on VIE with ENG, reinforce BUD defenses against ITA's attack, and feign weakness to misdirect TUR/RUS. Prioritize holding VIE and BUD while leveraging ENG's Adriatic blockade to isolate ITA.</li>

ENG reinforced Adriatic via F MAO, while GER and FRA contested central regions (BUR, MUN).). ITA's fleet in ION and TYS threatened southern Austria. AUT's units held key positions but faced multi-front pressure.
Failed to secure TUR truce despite concessions; TUR remains hostile. ENG reaffirmed alliance, confirming F MAO support for VIE assault. ITA rejected truce, escalating VIE conflict.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, Austria's coordinated strike with ENG faltered as ENG refused to support A BUD's RUM assault or convoy forces to MAR. TUR rejected truce offers, maintaining hostile stance, while ITA demanded TRI in exchange for VIE withdrawal. RUS issued threats over prior betrayals.
ENG broke commitment to support RUM/MAR operations, undermining strategy. TUR and ITA refused concessions, escalating tensions. Broken promises from ENG on naval coordination and MAR landing. TUR's intransigence forced Austria to pivot to contingency plans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute RUM assault via A VIE + A BUD/F TRI support. F ADR blockades ION to isolate ITA. Deceive TUR with false truce talks while striking RUM. If ENG's blockade holds, exploit TUR's exposed flank. Prioritize securing VIE/BUD cores while maintaining plausible deniability in Adriatic negotiations.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1924M, TUR launched a coordinated assault on BUD with A ANK and A RUM, supported by A GAL and A SER, while ITA advanced on VIE via A TYR. ENG maintained naval pressure on ITA with blockades, but refused to commit to the MAR convoy. RUS advanced into SEV and MOS, signaling further aggression.
Austria's desperate overtures for truces and alliances were rejected by TUR and ITA, which remain hostile. ENG hesitated on critical support (MAR convoy), settling for Balkan coordination. FRA refused to commit beyond opportunistic Balkan gains. All major powers remain hostile to AUT except tentative ENG alignment.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Defend BUD against TUR's assault via A BUD holds + F ADR supports F TRI to intercept TUR's naval access. A VIE counterattacks ITA's TYR with A VIE - TYR to disrupt their VIE advance. Coordinate F TRI with ENG's fleets to trap ITA's Adriatic units. Prioritize survival through tactical defense and delaying actions while exploiting ENG's naval strength.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> TUR and ITA launched coordinated attacks on AUT's core (BUD, VEN), while ENG's naval forces positioned to contest the Adriatic. TUR's A RUM and A SER attacked BUD, ITA's A APU advanced on VEN, and FRA/GER maintained pressure elsewhere. AUT's prior moves included failed support requests and exposed supply centers.
AUT desperately sought alliances: proposed ENG-TUR-ITA power shifts, offered territorial concessions, and attempted to pit enemies against each other. ENG conditionally agreed to Adriatic coordination but demanded territorial cessions. TUR/ITA/RUS rebuffed all entreaties, maintaining hostile stances. Broken promises: TUR refused to withdraw from BUD despite AUT's concessions; ITA rejected truce and escalated VEN assault.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute ENG alliance: A BUD- SER via F VEN support to disrupt TUR's BUD assault. Coordinate F ALB with ENG's F MAO to blockade ITA's Adriatic fleet. Hold VIE as core. Deceive TUR by feigning RUM cession while secretly coordinating ENG to target TUR's GRE. Promise MAR/APU to ITA to delay their advance, then exploit ENG's naval power to crush ITA's exposed fleets. Maintain hostile posture vs RUS via VIE positioning.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT's prior moves aimed to coordinate with ENG against ITA via a MAR convoy but faced ENG's hesitation and TUR/ITA/RUS aggression. F VEN retreated to TRI after failed offensive, leaving AUT isolated with TUR advancing on BUD/RUM and ITA securing VEN/APU.
AUT's desperate truce offers were rejected by TUR/ITA, who demanded unconditional surrender. ENG hesitated on committing naval support despite alliance, while RUS escalated threats. Promises to cede territories went unfulfilled due to ENG's reluctance and TUR/ITA's refusal to negotiate.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> 1. A BUD holds with A VIE support to resist TUR's RUM/SER pressure. 2. F ALB -> ADR to disrupt ITA's naval supply lines. 3. F TRI supports F ALB's move to ADR. 4. Deceive ITA by maintaining truce talks while reinforcing BUD defenses. 5. Coordinate with ENG's F MAO to blockade ITA's Adriatic SCs. 6. Prioritize survival by disengaging from APU/MAR disputes.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: ENG, coordinated Adriatic dominance demands immediate action. I propose: 1. A VIE - MAR via your F MAO convoy, supported by F ALB. 2. F ALB - ADR to block ITA's naval retreat. We split MAR/APU post-victory. Your F MAO must support my A VIE's MAR assault. Confirm by S1926M:2. AUT will hold BUD with A VIE support while you blockade ION. Failure to commit risks ITA's survival.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR: AUT offers a conditional truce on BUD if your forces withdraw from RUM/SER. In exchange, we can jointly target ITA's Adriatic SCs (MAR, APU). I propose A BUD - GAL to counter RUS, freeing your armies to strike ITA's VEN. This secures mutual interests - reject ITA's advances first, then divide spoils. Reply by S1926M:2.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA: Your Adriatic overextension is fatal. AUT proposes a temporary armistice: cede TRI to you in exchange for withdrawal from VEN/APU. We can then jointly resist TUR's Balkan advances. Refusal leaves you isolated - ENG's F MAO and my F ALB will crush your fleet this spring. Decide swiftly.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your situation is dire. Your empire is crumbling, and your pleas for a truce are falling on deaf ears. I offer you one final chance to surrender unconditionally. Cede Trieste and Vienna to Turkey, and I will guarantee the safety of your remaining territories. Refuse, and I will continue my relentless advance until your empire is extinguished.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> TUR attacked BUD via A SER and A GRE, while ITA resisted via TRI/TYS. ENG maintained naval blockades in ADR/ION, FRA and GER held central positions. RUS advanced into UKR. Austria's units remain intact but surrounded by hostile forces.
Failed to secure TUR truce despite offering BUD/RUM concessions. ITA refused all withdrawals, doubling down on Adriatic claims. ENG hesitated over MAR convoy plan, proposing alternative TRI assault. Promises: AUT promised BUD/RUM to TUR (unfulfilled), ENG failed to commit to convoy plan. TUR and ITA remained implacable.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A VIE-MAR via ENG's F MAO convoy supported by F ALB. A BUD holds with support from VIE. Deceive ENG by feigning continued alliance while secretly preparing to seize MAR independently. Target ITA's MAR/APU SCs to weaken their naval position. Prepare for TUR counterattacks via SER/BUD.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria's S1927M attack on VIE via A TYR supported by F ADR failed as TUR's A BUD captured VIE with A GAL support. TUR also advanced into GAL/UKR, while ITA resisted overtures by reinforcing TRI/APU. ENG provided critical support via F MAO to ADR and F NTH, but GER's A BOH-MUN complicates central dynamics.
Failed to secure truces with TUR/ITA despite cession offers; TUR demanded unconditional surrender while ITA insisted on TRI. ENG fully cooperated with Adriatic blockade plans and confirmed VEN cession post-victory. Deceptive negotiations with ITA maintained to delay their response.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A TYR - VIE supported by F ADR, coordinate with ENG's F MAO to ADR to block ITA's ION fleet. Cede VEN to ENG as agreed. Maintain false ITA negotiations to isolate their fleet while focusing on reclaiming VIE. Use F ADR to intercept ITA's TYS-bound fleet if possible.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> TUR captured BUD and VIE, overrunning AUT's heartland, while ITA advanced on VEN/TRI and ENG's fleet (F MAO) positioned to support AUT's Adriatic strategy. TUR's A GAL and A SER overran VIE, while ITA's forces pushed into Venetian territories.
AUT desperately sought to solidify the ENG alliance to trap ITA's fleet in ION while fending off TUR's land assault. ENG cautiously cooperated but refused high-risk MAR convoy plans. ITA and TUR rejected all offers, with ITA declaring war on AUT's holdings and TUR demanding unconditional surrender.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Support ENG's F MAO into ION via F ADR support to isolate ITA's Adriatic fleet, while publicly feigning cooperation with ITA to delay their advance. Secretly coordinate with ENG to cut ITA's supply lines. Hold F ADR as the sole remaining unit while preparing for inevitable TUR land assault.</li>
