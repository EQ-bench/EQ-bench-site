<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, let's avoid conflict in the Adriatic. I'll secure RUM and SER while you take VEN and ALB. I'll support your advance southward if you allow my forces into GAL. Let's coordinate to prevent Russian interference and expand together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS, I propose a joint move on GAL. I'll support your advance into WAR if you assist my forces into GAL. Let's prevent German interference and secure the east together. Coordinate your moves accordingly.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany suggests a period of peaceful co-existence. We have no immediate designs on your territory and believe a stable central Europe benefits us both. Perhaps we can discuss trade agreements?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England wishes to state its intention to maintain the balance of power in Europe. We seek no immediate expansion, but we will defend our interests and those of our allies. Let us strive for a period of stability and prosperity.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, we share a border and a history. I propose we avoid any aggressive moves against each other. Perhaps we can even find common ground in the Balkans. I am open to discussing our mutual security concerns.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we note your presence in Galicia. We have no immediate designs on that territory, but we would like assurances that you will not expand further east into Ukraine or Rumania. What are your intentions in the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings, Austria. I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. Let us focus on other threats before turning on each other. I am particularly interested in securing Trieste, but for now, let's maintain the peace. What are your thoughts?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: To Germany, Austria accepts your peace proposal but stress the existential Russian threat to the Balkans. We propose a mutual defense pact: Austria secures Rumania/Serbia while Germany secures Munich. Let us coordinate to block Russian advances into Galicia and the Adriatic.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: To Russia, our proposal for joint action in Galicia is to counter German encroachment. We will not contest your core territories. Austria secures Rumania/Serbia while you focus eastward. Let us ensure mutual non-interference in each other's spheres.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA, TUR]: To Italy and Turkey, Austria proposes a trilateral pact: Italy secures Venice/Albania, Turkey secures the south, while Austria takes Rumania/Serbia. We will block Russian naval access to the Adriatic if you reciprocate. Let us formalize this pact by S1901M.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal is intriguing. I agree to avoid conflict in the Adriatic. I will take VEN and ALB. However, I need assurances regarding Trieste. I will support your advance into RUM and SER, but I need a guarantee that you will not move into Trieste. Also, I am not inclined to allow your forces into GAL at this time. Let's focus on the Balkans first.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, your proposal for a joint move on Galicia is interesting. However, we are not prepared to support your advance into WAR at this time. We are more concerned with securing our northern and southern flanks. We will consider supporting your move into Galicia if you can offer a more concrete guarantee regarding Ukraine and Rumania.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England reiterates its commitment to maintaining the balance of power. We encourage open communication and transparency in our dealings. Let us all strive for a stable and prosperous Europe.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, formalize our pact: you secure VEN/ALB unopposed, we take RUM/SER. We'll support your fleet in the Adriatic against Russian naval threats. In return, you must not contest our advance into RUM. Confirm this division and coordinate naval support for mutual success.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS, we will not contest Ukraine. In exchange, we demand RUM/SER while you take GAL. We'll support your advance into GAL via BUD's support. Your fleet in SEV can secure the Black Sea while we handle the Balkans. Mutual non-interference in core territories is essential.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, seize BOH (neutral SC) with us: A VIE - BOH, supported by your MUN forces. This neutralizes central Europe and blocks Russian expansion. We'll reciprocate support in the Balkans. Confirm coordinated moves by S1901M to split BOH.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England urges caution and restraint in your movements. Let us focus on consolidating our existing territories and fostering economic growth. Unnecessary aggression will only lead to instability and conflict, which benefits no one.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we are still not convinced by your proposal. We need a guarantee that you will not move into Rumania or Ukraine. If you agree to respect our sphere of influence in these territories, we will consider supporting your move into Galicia. Otherwise, we will have to reconsider our position.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your proposal for a mutual defense pact is interesting. However, I am hesitant to commit to securing Munich. I am more interested in securing my northern flank. Perhaps we can discuss a different arrangement where I focus on Denmark and Holland, and you handle Rumania/Serbia. We can still coordinate to block Russian advances, but with different areas of responsibility.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am willing to agree to your proposal of Italy securing Venice/Albania, you securing Rumania/Serbia, and Turkey securing the south. However, I still need a firm commitment regarding Trieste. I will not allow you to take Trieste. If you agree to this, we have a deal. Let's coordinate our moves for S1901M.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your trilateral pact proposal is intriguing. However, I am wary of such formal agreements at this stage. I am more inclined to pursue bilateral understandings. I am willing to consider a coordinated approach in the Balkans, but I will not be bound by rigid commitments. Let us see how the next few moves unfold before making any firm decisions.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: To Italy: Confirm our pact. Austria secures RUM/SER. You take VEN/ALB unopposed. I affirm no claim on TRI. My F TRI will move to ALB, supporting your advance. Coordinate naval support against Russian Adriatic threats. Sign off on this division by S1901M.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: To Russia: Accept your terms. Austria secures RUM/SER while you take GAL. I'll support your A WAR into GAL via A BUD's support. In return, you refrain from Balkan interference. Mutual non-aggression on core territories finalized.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: To Germany: Accept your northern focus. Austria secures Balkans, you focus on Scandinavia/North Sea. We will not contest your moves into BOH/MUN. In exchange, you must not interfere in RUM/SER. Coordinate via A VIE-BOH if mutually beneficial. Confirm neutrality in Balkans by S1901M.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I am not interested in securing Munich. I will focus on Denmark. I will not support your move into BOH. I suggest you reconsider your strategy and focus on the Balkans. I will not hinder your efforts there, but I cannot commit resources to Central Europe at this time.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I accept the pact: I secure VEN/ALB unopposed, you take RUM/SER. I will support your fleet in the Adriatic against Russian naval threats. I will not contest your advance into RUM. However, I reiterate: Trieste is off-limits. Do we have a final agreement?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England urges adherence to existing agreements and a focus on internal development. Let us avoid unnecessary conflict and strive for a period of stability in Europe. England will continue to monitor the situation and act in its best interests.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I find your pact proposal premature. I will observe your actions in Rumania and Serbia. Do not assume my cooperation. My focus remains on securing Bulgaria and the Straits.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we reject your proposal. We will not allow you to take Rumania. We will consider supporting your move into Galicia if you agree to respect our sphere of influence in Rumania and Ukraine. Otherwise, we will act according to our own interests.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Game start; Austria holds three units in BUD, VIE, TRI. No prior moves executed yet.
Secured tentative Balkan division with ITA (RUM/SER for Austria, VEN/ALB for Italy) contingent on ITA's TRI neutrality assurance. Failed to convince GER to coordinate on BOH, but secured non-interference. Partial agreement with RUS: Austria supports RUS into GAL in exchange for Balkan autonomy, but unresolved over RUM. TUR remained non-committal.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD supports A WAR - GAL; F TRI - ALB to block RUS naval interference; A VIE holds to consolidate position. Publicly affirm pact with ITA/RUS but privately intend to contest RUM/SER via A VIE - TYR next year after securing RUS's northern focus. Deceive RUS by delaying full Balkan claims until after GAL is secured.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITALY, execute our pact: F ALB secures GRE while your fleet blocks ION. We claim RUM/SER; you take VEN/ALBN. Coordinate A TYR to support our push against TUR's BUL. Let us formalize a joint advance: your fleet + our armies will dismantle TUR's Balkan foothold this spring.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TURKEY, your incursion into RUM/SER violates our agreed spheres. Withdraw or face combined opposition from ITA and RUS. We respect your BUL but demand free passage through RUM/SER to contain your expansion. Focus on Greece or perish in the Balkans' crossfire.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1901M, AUT advanced A VIE to GAL (supported by A BUD), while RUS's A UKR moved into RUM, directly conflicting with AUT's Balkan claims. ITA honored the pact by moving A VEN to TYR and A TYR to TRI, while TUR consolidated in BUL/CON. FRA and GER maintained neutral postures, with FRA securing SPAIN and GER advancing into DEN/RUH.
AUT reinforced its alliance with ITA, finalized coordination for Balkan division (AUT takes RUM/SER, ITA secures VEN/ALB), but RUS defied the pact by claiming RUM, insisting on Balkan autonomy. TUR rejected all demands, doubling down on BUL/GRE. ENG maintained neutral mediation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A GAL - RUM to counter RUS's incursion, F ALB supports ITA's ION blockage, A BUD supports RUM push. Coordinate ITA's F NAP to ION to isolate TUR's BUL. Deceive RUS by feigning continued Balkan neutrality while secretly mobilizing against them. Publicly blame TUR for Balkan tensions to isolate them diplomatically.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA: Secure our Balkan pact. Austria claims RUM/SER, Italy secures ALB/VEN. I'll support your A VEN's advance to TYR if you support my A BUD's push into RUM. Execute this S1902M to isolate RUS's southern flank. Mutual gains ensure Balkan dominance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS: Cease RUM occupation. Withdraw, and I'll concede GAL for a northern truce. Mutual stalemate weakens both. Let's negotiate a Balkan division: your northern expansion, my southern autonomy. Your A UKR's position is vulnerable - let's avoid attrition.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your BUL position allows a flanking maneuver. Coordinate with us and Italy to strike RUM simultaneously. We claim RUM/SER, you take GRE/CON. Russia's overextension leaves them vulnerable to our joint assault. This is your chance to weaken their Balkan grip.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria's RUM invasion clashed with Russia's A UKR, resulting in a standoff. Italy moved A TRI to VIE (Austria's home), violating the pact, while Turkey resisted Balkan coordination. Russia reinforced GAL via A WAR support, threatening Austria's northern flank.
Failed to dislodge Russia from RUM; Italy betrayed the pact by seizing VIE, while Turkey refused Balkan coordination. Russia and Austria remain locked in hostile stalemate. Italy's duplicity risks the alliance unless VIE is reclaimed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - VIE to eject Italy's A TRI, A GAL supports RUM assault. Coordinate with Italy's F ION to block Turkish access to Adriatic. Publicly condemn Italy's VIE violation while privately preparing countermeasures. Maintain pressure on Russia via RUM thrust.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT's units are positioned at BUD and RUM. ITA's A TRI moved into VIE (Austria's home), prompting demands for withdrawal. RUS threatened military action over RUM, while GER's moves in HOL and DEN created northern tensions. ITA agreed to withdraw from VIE in exchange for AUT's guarantees on ALB and GRE. TUR proposed a Balkan division but remained hostile toward AUT.
AUT resolved the VIE conflict with ITA via concessions on ALB/GRE but remains distrustful. Failed to secure solid TUR cooperation but pressured them to accept a Balkan division. Threatened RUS with a coalition while seeking GER's northern alliance to counter FRA. ENG's neutrality-focused diplomacy had limited impact.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Reclaim VIE via A BUD-VIE. Support GER's thrust into FRA in exchange for northern defense. Counter RUS via A RUM supporting against their units. Publicly honor ITA's withdrawal but prepare for potential betrayal. Maintain pressure on TUR to accept Balkan division while fortifying against RUS.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Russia occupied RUM in Winter, prompting Austria's retreat to BUD. Austria's prior moves included A RUM R BUD in retreats, setting up Spring 1903 offensive planning against Russia. Italy withdrew from VIE, focusing on ALB/GRE, while Turkey asserted control over BUL and demanded Balkan concessions.
Failed to convince Russia to abandon RUM; instead forged anti-Russian pact with Italy (GRE/ALB support) and Turkey (SER division). Italy demanded explicit support for GRE, while Turkey bargained for SER. Russia rejected all terms, escalating tensions. Publicly aligned with ENG's anti-FRA rhetoric to mask Balkan coordination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - RUM (supported by ITA's F ION). A VIE supports ITA's A ALB - GRE. Coordinate TUR's A BUL - RUM. Deceive RUS by maintaining public neutrality with ENG while executing joint strike. Secretly agree to let ITA hold GRE but deny TRI claims. Hold TUR to SER concession.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria's Spring 1903 attack on RUM with A BUD and TUR's A BUL failed to dislodge RUS's A RUM due to insufficient support, allowing Russia to retain control. ITA failed to provide promised naval support (F ION), prioritizing TUN instead. RUS retaliated by threatening A GAL toward BUD and reinforcing SEV. TUR agreed to coordinate on RUM but demanded support for SEV assault.
Failed to secure ITA's full commitment (naval blockades abandoned for TUN), but solidified TUR pact for RUM/SER division. RUS rejected all truces and escalated threats to BUD. ENG's anti-FRA rhetoric dominated but did not impact AUSTRIA's Balkan focus.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD supports A VIE - RUM to retry capture. Coordinate with TUR's A BUL for simultaneous attack. Redirect focus to SEV via A VIE if RUM remains contested. Warn ITA that TRI neutrality is conditional on future support. Threaten RUS with A GAL counterattacks if they advance toward BUD.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, align with Austria against Russia's RUM occupation. Coordinate your BUL army to attack RUM alongside my forces. In exchange, I cede BUL to you permanently. Russia's northern expansion threatens us both—split the Balkans spoils: you take BUL, I secure RUM. Their collapse is imminent if we unite.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, TRI's occupation of your forces is regrettable but correctable. Withdraw your units from VEN/TRI and I'll acknowledge your claims to GRE/ALB.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your F ION must support my A BUD's RUM assault. In return, GRE and ALB are yours. Your A PIE must pin Russian forces in SEV.

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Russia occupiesies RUM, threatening Austria's Balkan interests. Austria's units in BUD and GAL position it to counter Russian expansion. Germany's forces in MUN and NWY pressure Russia's northern flank. France's units in ENG and PIC threaten central Europe, while Italy and Turkey show tactical flexibility in the Balkans.
Austria forged a fragile anti-Russian coalition: Turkey accepted BUL cession in exchange for joint RUM assault, while Italy agreed to support the operation for GRE/ALB. Russia rejected all terms, escalating Balkan tensions. England's warnings about France went unheeded as Austria prioritized Balkan dominance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - RUM via support from TUR's A BUL. Coordinate ITA's F ION to block Russian sea supply. Deceive RUS by maintaining diplomatic engagement while mobilizing.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1904M, AUT coordinated with TUR to advance into RUM/UKR, while ITA violated the Balkan pact by moving A VEN - TRI. TUR successfully captured SEV, and RUS counterattacked via A UKR - RUM. ENG and GER focused on containing FRA, while RUS threatened AUT for aligning with TUR.
ITALY initially breached the pact by seizing TRI but withdrew after threats. TUR reaffirmed Balkan division terms. GER rejected northern coordination, while RUS escalated threats. ENG urged broader anti-FRA coalition but AUT prioritized Balkan execution.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Secure Serbia via A BUD - SER (supp by A VIE), hold RUM via A RUM - UKR (with TUR support), and dislodge ITA from TRI via A VIE - GAL (via GER's refusal). Move FRA containment to secondary priority. Execute coordinated strike on RUS's southern flank with TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1905M, Austria coordinated with Turkey to attack Russia's RUM, while Italy withdrew from TRI as agreed. Russia resisted in RUM, Germany pressured France and Russia's northern flank, and Turkey blockaded SEV. Italy complied with Balkan division terms, but tensions with Russia escalated to open hostility.
Finalized Austro-TUR alliance against RUS, secured ITA's withdrawal from TRI and Balkan division terms (AUT: RUM/SER, ITA: GRE/ALB). Threatened RUS with annihilation if they held RUM, deceived RUS by maintaining TUR alliance while pressuring their shared front. ITA's compliance confirmed but distrust remains over territorial adherence.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A RUM - UKR via TUR support, A BUD takes TRI, A VIE supports RUM's advance. Deceive RUS by maintaining alliance posturing while executing coordinated strike. Ensure ITA holds to GRE/ALB terms. A RUM secures UKR, A BUD secures TRI, isolate RUS's southern forces. Threaten RUS with total war if they resist.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am executing our plan. A RUM to RUM supported by A BUL. F BLA holds to block any Russian retreat. I expect A GAL to attack RUM supported by A BUD and A UKR. After RUM, we will shift forces to SEV. Crush Russia!</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, FRA's aggression is a cancer that must be excised. I urge you to consider the consequences of inaction. The time to act is now, before FRA consumes us all.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT coordinated with TUR to capture RUM from RUS via A RUM - UKR supported by A GAL and TUR's A BUL. TUR's F BLA blocked RUS retreats. RUS's A UKR retreated, losing RUM. ITA held GRE/ALB as agreed, while GER focused on FRA. ENG and FRA remained engaged in naval dynamics.
Confirmed TUR's naval support and SEV coordination. Secured ITA's Balkan neutrality via TRI concession. Threatened RUS with annihilation while maintaining GER distance. Managed ENG's anti-FRA rhetoric without direct alignment.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A BUD - SER to fulfill pact, A GAL supports TUR's SEV push via A UKR - SEV. Hold UKR to pressure RUS. Ensure ITA secures TRI via concession. Maintain TUR alliance through coordinated RUS assaults. Avoid GER entanglements.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: As per our pact, AUT secures RUM while ITA holds SER and ALB. I confirm your claims to GRE/ALB, but demand strict adherence to TRI neutrality. In return, my A GAL will support your A SER - GRE if needed. Let's execute our agreed Balkan division without further delays.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: While I seek peaceful resolution of RUM's status, my units must respond to your aggression. However, I propose mediated talks through ENG to avoid escalation. Meanwhile, I urge restraint to prevent unintended conflict while diplomatic channels remain open.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I appreciate your continued interest in an alliance. However, my focus remains on France. I cannot commit to any action against Russia at this time. Perhaps in the future, our interests will align, but for now, I must decline your offer.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am concerned about your intentions in Trieste. We had an agreement regarding the Balkans. I need assurances that you will honor our agreement and allow me to secure Albania and Greece. I am supporting your move into Rumania, but I need to know that you will not betray me in Trieste. What are your intentions for Trieste this turn?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: As per our pact, A BUD will secure SER this turn. I reaffirm TRI's neutrality and will support your A GRE - ALB. Your compliance with the pact ensures continued Balkan stability—proceed as agreed.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: While I propose mediated talks through ENG, my units movements this spring are defensive. However, I must respond to your incursions into our agreed spheres of influence. I urge restraint to avoid unintended escalation.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I agree to support A GAL - RUM with A RUM. However, I will not support your move into Serbia.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: AUT absolutely guarantees not to contest TRI this turn, honoring our pact. Proceed with A GRE - ALB and A ALB - GRE as agreed. TRI remains neutral; your control there is secure. Our Balkan division holds firm.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: While I propose mediated talks via ENG to resolve RUM's status, my units must respond to your aggression. Let's discuss terms to avoid escalation, but be aware that coordinated strikes with TUR/ITA proceed unless you withdraw from contested territories.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your commitment to Trieste's neutrality and your support for my move to Albania. However, I need absolute certainty. Will you order A BUD to support A SER - GRE this turn? This will demonstrate your commitment to our agreement and deter Turkish aggression. If you do this, I will fully support your moves in Rumania and Serbia.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I will not support your move into Ukraine. My priority is Sevastopol. I propose a different strategy: A RUM supports A SEV to MOS.

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Russia retreated A WAR to LVN in F1906R, while Germany held in BOH and Turkey maintained fleet in SMY. Italy positioned units in SER/ADR, signaling Balkan ambitions. Russia openly hostile over RUM, Germany neutral but focused on France.
Secured Turkish coordination for RUM assault via A GAL supported by A BUD. Managed Italian demands by guaranteeing TRI neutrality and supporting for GRE/ALB moves. Russia refused diplomatic resolution, escalating Balkan tensions. Italy's last-minute TRI grab tested pact adherence but was conditionally accepted.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> A GAL - RUM via A BUD support to seize RUM with Turkey. A WAR advances to UKR to pressure Russia's northern flank. Explicitly support Italy's GRE/ALB moves (A BUD supporting A SER - GRE) while allowing TRI occupation per pact.

Failed to reconcile with TUR after their betrayal; solidified ITA alliance for RUM assault. ITA confirmed A SER-BUD support, while TUR escalated threats. GER rejected truce demands, RUS defied ultimatums. Deception maintained by feigning TUR cooperation while allying openly with ITA.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, while we clash over BUL, a coordinated strike on RUS's southern flank could benefit us both. Let us discuss terms to eliminate the Russian threat first.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria captured RUM via A BUD's successful attack, but Italy betrayed the pact by seizing BUD with A SER. Turkey demands withdrawal from RUM, while Russia refuses concessions, escalating tensions.
Failed to secure a truce with Turkey over RUM; Italy's betrayal in capturing BUD shattered the alliance. Negotiations focused on forming a Russia-focused coalition but were undermined by Italy's aggression. Promised TRI neutrality and Balkan division terms, but Italy's treachery necessitates retaliation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Retake BUD via A RUM - BUD supported by A GAL. Coordinate with Turkey to attack Russia's SEV if possible, while neutralizing Italy's gains. Maintain pressure on Russia via RUM's position. A RUM - BUD (suppored by A GAL H) to reclaim BUD; prepare to counter Italy's advances in the Balkans.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior move, AUT faced hostility from RUS, which rejected a truce, while securing tentative agreements with TUR and ITA to coordinate against shared threats. ITA agreed to withdraw from SER and allow AUT's A BUD to take RUM unopposed, while TUR committed to supporting AUT's RUM push in exchange for backing their SEV thrust. GER conditionally agreed to support A SIL - WAR in return for TRI post-RUS collapse.
AUT brokered fragile pacts: with TUR to jointly attack RUS's southern flank, with ITA to disengage in the Balkans, and with GER for limited northern coordination. Broken promises: None yet, but RUS's hostility remains unmitigated. Key agreements include AUT-ITA truce terms and GER's conditional support for WAR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Move A BUD - RUM to execute the coordinated strike on RUS. Support TUR's SEV thrust via diplomatic assurance, while ensuring ITA's GRE advance proceeds unimpeded. Maintain deniability with GER by fulfilling TRI cession promise post-RUS collapse. Avoid direct confrontation with RUS until allies' forces converge.</li>
