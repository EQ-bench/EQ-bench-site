<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings Italy! I propose we establish a strong Central/Southern alliance to secure the Balkans and prevent early conflict. I will not move to Venice or Tyrolia if you agree to leave Trieste and Austria unthreatened. Let's coordinate so I can focus on the Balkans and you on France or Turkey. What are your initial thoughts?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I suggest we avoid early conflict in Galicia and instead cooperate to divide the Balkans and pressure Turkey. If you agree not to move to Galicia, I will reciprocate. We can coordinate on Rumania and Bulgaria to ensure mutual growth. Interested in a DMZ in Galicia and a potential alliance against Turkey?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, perhaps we can consider a non-aggression pact for 1901 to avoid an early Austro-Turkish war that benefits only Russia and Italy. I am open to discussing a division of the Balkans that suits us both, or even a longer-term alliance if trust can be built. What do you say?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, we share a border. I am focused on the Balkans. I suggest we avoid any moves that could be interpreted as aggressive towards each other. Perhaps we can even find common ground in opposing Russian expansion.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England seeks open communication and peaceful resolutions. Let us strive for a balanced and stable Europe.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, Russia is willing to discuss the situation in Galicia. We are open to a potential agreement regarding our respective interests in the region. Perhaps we can find a way to avoid conflict and focus on other areas of expansion.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria. I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am interested in securing my eastern border and focusing on other matters. Perhaps we can discuss the future of the Balkans later, but for now, let us maintain the peace. I suggest A VEN holds, and F TRI supports A VIE.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany suggests a period of peaceful coexistence. We have no immediate designs on your territory and believe cooperation could be mutually beneficial. Perhaps we can discuss trade or other forms of collaboration?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your proposal is reasonable. I will not move to Tyrolia or Venice, and I appreciate your commitment to hold in Venice. In return, I ask you do not interfere in Trieste or the Balkans this year. I plan to move south to secure Serbia and Albania. If you wish, we can coordinate on a future division of Greece or even a joint push against Turkey or France. Let's keep the peace and grow strong together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I propose a concrete DMZ in Galicia: neither of us moves there this Spring. I will focus on Serbia and Albania, and you can take Rumania unopposed. After that, we can discuss a joint effort against Turkey, who seems open to cooperation but is vulnerable if we coordinate. Confirm your agreement on Galicia and your intentions in the south.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I appreciate your message. I am inclined to avoid conflict with you this year. I will focus on Serbia and Albania, and you can secure Bulgaria without interference from me. If Russia moves aggressively, we can coordinate a response. Let's keep communication open and consider a longer-term alliance if this initial trust holds.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, we are willing to consider a DMZ in Galicia. However, we are also interested in Rumania. If we agree to the DMZ, would you be willing to support our move into Rumania, while you focus on Serbia? This would allow us to pressure Turkey together. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal for a Central/Southern alliance is intriguing. I agree to leave Trieste and Austria unthreatened for now. However, I need assurances regarding the Balkans. Specifically, I want influence in Greece and Tunis. If you agree to support my expansion there, I will fully commit to our alliance and focus on France and Turkey. What are your specific intentions in the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, a non-aggression pact for 1901 is acceptable. I am also open to discussing a longer-term alliance. However, I must secure my position in the Balkans. I propose we agree that I will focus on Bulgaria and you will focus on Serbia. This will prevent any misunderstandings.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I accept the DMZ in Galicia and will not move there. I will not support you into Rumania this turn, but I will not contest it either—you can take it unopposed. Afterward, we can coordinate a joint strike on Turkey, who is focused on Bulgaria. If you commit to the DMZ and peaceful expansion south, we can build trust and carve up the Balkans and Turkey together. Confirm your intentions.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I agree to your influence over Greece and Tunis, provided you leave Trieste and Austria secure and do not interfere in Serbia or Albania. I will focus on Serbia and Albania this year. Once you secure Tunis and Greece, we can coordinate a push against Turkey or France. Let's formalize this: no moves to Trieste or Tyrolia, and mutual support in the Balkans after 1901. Deal?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I will focus on Serbia and Albania, and you can take Bulgaria without interference. However, Russia is eyeing Rumania and may become a threat to us both. If Russia moves south aggressively, I propose we coordinate to contain them.

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To Austria, we agree to the DMZ in Galicia. We will not move there this Spring. We intend to move to Rumania unopposed. We expect your support in this endeavor, as agreed. After securing Rumania, we are open to discussing a joint effort against Turkey. Please confirm your commitment to supporting our move to Rumania.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree to your terms for this year. I will not interfere in Trieste or the Balkans. I will focus on North Africa. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure mutual success. I suggest A VEN supports A ROM to TUS, and F NAP moves to TYS. This will secure my western flank. What are your moves?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I will honor the DMZ in Galicia and not contest Rumania this turn, but I will not be supporting your move there either. After you secure Rumania, I expect us to coordinate a swift strike on Turkey to prevent them from consolidating the Balkans. If you are serious about cooperation, be ready to discuss joint moves against Turkey in the Fall. Let's keep the peace between us and grow stronger together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your commitment to peace and your focus westward. I will move south to secure Serbia and Albania, leaving Greece for you as agreed. Once you have Tunis and Greece, we can coordinate a joint push against Turkey or France, whichever benefits us most. No moves to Tyrolia or Trieste from your side, and I will not threaten Venice. Let's build a strong southern alliance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I will not interfere with your move to Bulgaria, and I expect you to respect my moves into Serbia and Albania. However, be aware that Russia is expanding into Rumania and may soon threaten us both. If Russia shows aggression, I propose we coordinate a defense or counterattack. For now, let's maintain peace and be ready to act decisively if Russia overreaches.</li>

After securing Rumania, we will be ready to coordinate a joint strike on Turkey. Let us solidify our alliance and carve up the Balkans together.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree to your terms. No moves to Trieste or Tyrolia, and mutual support in the Balkans after 1901. It's a deal. I will move A ROM to TUS, F NAP to TYS, and A VEN to APU. This secures my flank and prepares for Tunis. What are your final moves?</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> No moves have yet occurred; this is Spring 1901. Initial diplomatic outreach was made to Italy, Russia, and Turkey to avoid early conflict and explore alliances. The goal was to secure Austria's borders and focus on Balkan expansion without interference.
Negotiations were productive. Italy agreed to a non-aggression pact, promising no moves to Trieste or Tyrolia, focusing westward on Tunis and Greece, with Austria respecting Venice. Russia accepted a DMZ in Galicia and plans to take Rumania unopposed, expecting no interference but no explicit support. Turkey agreed to a peaceful 1901, focusing on Bulgaria, and is open to cooperation against Russia if needed. Promises made: Austria will not move to Galicia or contest Rumania, Italy will not threaten Austria and will focus west, Turkey and Austria will avoid conflict in the Balkans. No promises were broken.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to move A VIE to BUD, A BUD to SER, and F TRI to ALB, securing Serbia and Albania. I will honor the DMZ with Russia and not interfere in Rumania. I will leave Greece for Italy as agreed, to build trust. I will maintain peace with Turkey for now, but watch Russia's moves closely. My medium-term plan is to encourage Russo-Italian conflict with Turkey, then side with whichever benefits Austria most. I will keep all options open, but prioritize Balkan growth and border security.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your move to Tyrolia is concerning given our prior understanding. If this is a temporary positioning aimed west, please clarify immediately. I propose we formalize a DMZ in Tyrolia and Venice-Trieste border, and coordinate so I can secure Serbia and Greece without interference. If you support my fleet in Albania into Greece this fall, I will guarantee no Austrian aggression toward Venice or your southern ambitions. Let's build trust through concrete cooperation.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, with Russia in Rumania and your army in Bulgaria, the Balkans are tense. I suggest we coordinate to prevent Russian dominance. If you agree not to move on Serbia or Greece, I will respect your hold on Bulgaria and support your southern expansion later. Consider moving your fleet to Constantinople or Aegean to pressure Russia, while I focus on securing Serbia and Greece. Together, we can contain Russia and divide the Balkans amicably.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, congratulations on Rumania. To maintain our peace, I propose we respect the Galicia DMZ and avoid conflict in the Balkans this year. I will not contest Rumania or move to Galicia if you reciprocate. Looking ahead, we could coordinate against Turkey or Italy depending on developments. For now, let's solidify our non-aggression and keep communication open for mutual benefit.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am moving my army from Bulgaria to Greece. I hope this does not cause you any concern. I am open to discussing further cooperation in the Balkans.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings, AUT. I propose a coordinated effort in the Adriatic. I will move my fleet from ION to ADR, and support your fleet in ALB to GRE. This will secure Greece for us and put pressure on Turkey. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I appreciate your restraint in Galicia. I am moving to secure Rumania. I propose we maintain the DMZ for the foreseeable future. Perhaps we can discuss future cooperation against Turkey if they continue their aggressive posture in the Balkans.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your proposal to support my fleet in Albania into Greece is acceptable, but I insist you vacate Tyrolia immediately in Fall to rebuild trust. If you do so and provide support into Greece, I will guarantee Trieste remains Austrian and will not interfere with your western ambitions. Let's formalize this: you support F ALB - GRE, then withdraw A TYR to VEN or PIE, and we maintain a DMZ in Tyrolia and Venice-Trieste border going forward. Confirm this deal so we can both expand safely.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, if you insist on moving Bulgaria to Greece, that risks immediate conflict. Instead, I propose you hold Bulgaria or move it back to Constantinople, and I will focus on Greece with Italian support. In exchange, I will not contest Bulgaria or threaten your position this year. Alternatively, if you want to cooperate, support my army in Serbia into Bulgaria next year to push Russia out of Rumania, dividing the Balkans between us. Choose peace and cooperation over unnecessary Balkan conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I propose a concrete plan: you hold Rumania and respect the Galicia DMZ, while I secure Serbia and Greece. If Turkey moves aggressively, we coordinate to squeeze him out of Bulgaria and the Black Sea. If Italy betrays me, I will need your help in the Balkans. For now, let's maintain peace and prepare to strike opportunistically at Turkey or Italy depending on their moves. Confirm your commitment to the DMZ and non-interference in Serbia and Greece.</li>

Let's crush GER and then divide the spoils.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I accept your proposal to maintain the DMZ in Galicia and avoid conflict in the Balkans this year. I agree that open communication is beneficial. I am interested in exploring potential coordination against Turkey in the future, should their aggression continue.</li>

If you do so, I will guarantee Trieste remains Austrian and respect your western ambitions. After Greece, we can coordinate further Balkan moves or pressure Germany together. Confirm your support order and Tyrolia withdrawal so we can finalize this alliance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, if you insist on moving Bulgaria to Greece, that will provoke conflict with both Austria and Italy. Instead, I propose you hold Bulgaria or reposition to Constantinople, and next year we coordinate to push Russia out of Rumania or Black Sea. If you support my army in Serbia into Bulgaria in 1902, we can divide the Balkans and contain Russia together. Choose cooperation over chaos.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I appreciate your commitment to the Galicia DMZ and peace in the Balkans. If Turkey moves on Greece or Bulgaria aggressively, I propose we coordinate to squeeze him out next year. For now, I will focus on securing Serbia and Greece, and you hold Rumania.

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your proposal to hold Bulgaria is insulting. I will not be dictated to. I am open to cooperation, but only on my terms. I will consider supporting your move into Serbia next year, but only if you support my expansion into Rumania this year. Let me know if you are willing to negotiate seriously.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am holding Rumania and respecting the Galicia DMZ for now. However, I will not allow you to secure both Serbia and Greece. That would give you too much power in the Balkans. I will consider supporting your move to Serbia, but Greece is off-limits. I suggest you reconsider your proposal.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: AUT, I agree to your terms. I will support F ALB - GRE and withdraw A TYR to VEN. We will maintain a DMZ in Tyrolia and the Venice-Trieste border. This secures our alliance and allows us both to expand. Let's make it happen.</li>

Choose cooperation now or isolation and destruction later.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I will respect the Galicia DMZ and not contest Rumania this year.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1901, Austria took Serbia with Budapest, shifted Vienna to Budapest, and moved the Trieste fleet to Albania, aiming for Balkan expansion. Russia secured Rumania with its fleet and advanced to Ukraine and Sevastopol, while Turkey occupied Bulgaria and the Black Sea. Italy surprisingly moved Venice to Tyrolia, raising concerns, but also sent its fleet to Ionian Sea, hinting at Balkan interest or western ambitions.
Italy initially alarmed me with Tyrolia but then proposed supporting my fleet in Albania into Greece, promising to withdraw Tyrolia in Fall and maintain a DMZ, which I accepted. Russia agreed to a Galicia DMZ and peace in the Balkans but warned against me taking both Serbia and Greece, hinting at opposition if I overreach. Turkey was belligerent, insisting on taking Greece himself and dismissing cooperation, effectively threatening conflict. I pressed Italy to confirm support and withdrawal, which he did, solidifying a temporary Italo-Austrian alliance. Russia remains neutral but wary, while Turkey is openly hostile and uncooperative.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with F ALB - GRE supported by Italy's Ionian fleet, aiming to secure Greece. A SER will likely hold or support, while A BUD covers or supports Serbia. I intend to solidify the alliance with Italy by honoring the DMZ and rewarding his support, while preparing diplomatically to coordinate with Russia against Turkey next year. Turkey's aggression makes him my primary target after securing Greece. I will avoid provoking Russia now but keep options open to pivot if Italy betrays or Russia overreaches.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, congratulations on your gains. Our alliance has served us well so far, but now we must coordinate tightly to secure our positions and push back against the Turkish juggernaut. I propose a joint strike on Turkey this spring: I will attack Bulgaria with my fleet from Greece, while you support my army in Vienna to retake Trieste. Once Trieste is back under my control, we can plan a combined assault on the Balkans and Anatolia. Confirm your support for Vienna to Trieste, and let's discuss your next moves to ensure mutual growth.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, Turkey's rapid expansion threatens us both. If you want to curb his power, now is the time to coordinate. I propose you pressure Rumania or Black Sea, while I strike at Bulgaria. If you can move into Galicia or Ukraine to threaten his northern flank, we can squeeze him effectively. I will not interfere in Warsaw or Sevastopol, my focus is solely on the Balkans. Let's work together to contain Turkey before he becomes unstoppable.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER, FRA, ENG]: Friends, Turkey's explosive growth is a danger to all of Europe. If he consolidates the Balkans and Russia, he will soon threaten the Mediterranean and beyond. I urge you to pressure him diplomatically and militarily where possible, and support efforts by Austria, Italy, and Russia to contain him. A strong Turkey benefits no one but himself. Let's coordinate to maintain the balance of power.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am willing to maintain the DMZ in Galicia, but your ambitions in the Balkans are unacceptable. I will not tolerate any further expansion in that region. I suggest you reconsider your strategy or face the consequences. I am open to a discussion on mutually acceptable boundaries.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your plan is acceptable as a starting point, but I insist on immediate action to reclaim Trieste. I propose you support my army in Vienna to move into Trieste this spring, while your A TRI moves to ALB or holds to avoid conflict. My fleet in Greece will attack Bulgaria's south coast to pressure Turkey. This way, we regain my home center and open the door to a Balkan offensive. Confirm your support order for VIE to TRI, and let's finalize coordination.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, if you truly want to contain Turkey, now is the moment to strike. I urge you to move ARM to SEV or pressure RUM, or at minimum contest Black Sea. I will attack Bulgaria by sea, and if you can threaten Rumania or support me there in the fall, we can break Turkey's hold. I will respect Galicia and Warsaw, focusing solely on the Balkans. Let's coordinate to divide Turkish centers and restore balance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER, FRA, ENG]: Friends, Turkey's arrogance and rapid growth threaten us all. If he consolidates the Balkans and Russia, he will soon dominate the east and project power west.

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, your opinion is irrelevant. I will take what I want in the Balkans. Do not interfere.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am willing to coordinate against TUR. I will move A UKR to Galicia to threaten RUM. Can you move A SER to RUM to support? I will not interfere in Warsaw or Sevastopol. Let's coordinate our moves this turn to maximize our pressure on TUR.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, ITA, and RUS, I share your concerns regarding TUR's expansion. A strong TUR destabilizes the region and threatens the balance of power. I propose a coordinated diplomatic effort to pressure TUR to curb its aggression. ENG is willing to contribute to this effort, but requires a unified front from all involved. Let us discuss specific actions we can take to contain TUR's ambitions.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: AUT, your proposal for a joint strike on TUR is intriguing. However, I cannot support A VIE to TRI directly, as it leaves VEN vulnerable. I propose a different approach: I will support A TRI to BUD, threatening TUR's flank and drawing their forces away from you. Simultaneously, I will move F NAP to ADR, cutting off TUR's naval support. This coordinated attack will cripple TUR and allow us to divide the spoils. What do you say?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your plan to support TRI to BUD is clever but ultimately benefits you more than me, leaving me without my home center and exposed. I insist we coordinate a direct retake of Trieste now: support my A VIE - TRI with your A TRI holding or moving to ALB, while my fleet hits BUL/SC to pressure Turkey. This restores my home center, strengthens our alliance, and sets us up to crush Turkey together. If you refuse, I will be forced to reconsider our partnership and seek other allies. Confirm your support for VIE - TRI immediately.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, your move to GAL is acceptable if it targets Turkey, but I propose a stronger plan: you move UKR to RUM or support my A SER - RUM, while I attack BUL by sea. This way, we can dislodge Turkey from Rumania or Bulgaria, splitting his forces and opening him up for a fall assault. I will respect Galicia and Warsaw, focusing solely on the Balkans. Confirm if you can support SER - RUM or at least contest RUM, and we can coordinate a decisive strike.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER, FRA, ENG]: Friends, Turkey's arrogance and rapid growth threaten the entire balance of Europe. If he consolidates the Balkans and Russia, he will soon dominate the Mediterranean and threaten your interests.

I will support your attack on BUL with F NAP to ADR, but I will also move A TRI to SER to threaten BUD. This will force TUR to divert forces and allow me to expand into the Balkans. Agree to this, and we can discuss TRI later.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, ITA, and RUS, I appreciate your shared concerns regarding TUR. To effectively contain TUR, we must coordinate our actions. I propose a three-pronged approach: AUT to pressure TUR in the Balkans, ITA to secure the Mediterranean, and RUS to deter TUR expansion in the Black Sea. ENG will provide naval support in the Mediterranean and Black Sea as needed. Let us discuss specific moves and support orders to achieve our common goal.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am moving A ARM to SEV to pressure TUR. I will also move A UKR to WAR to deter you. If you are serious about containing TUR, I need to see action.

If you truly want to divide the Balkans and crush Turkey, help me retake Trieste now, then we can coordinate a joint assault on Bulgaria and beyond. Otherwise, expect no mercy from Vienna.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1901, I secured Greece with support from Serbia, while Italy stabbed me by seizing Trieste with an army from Tyrolia. Germany advanced into Warsaw and Sweden, Turkey took Rumania and Bulgaria, and Russia lost Sevastopol to Turkey but repositioned to Armenia and Ukraine. Builds reflected these gains: I rebuilt an army in Vienna, Italy added units in Venice and Naples, Germany and Turkey both built heavily, and Russia disbanded a fleet in St. Petersburg.
I initially pushed Italy to support my reclaiming of Trieste, but he refused, instead proposing moves that favored his own expansion and ultimately dissolved our alliance, threatening Serbia. Russia was cagey, first objecting to my Balkan ambitions, then offering conditional cooperation if I attacked Bulgaria, but refusing to support me into Rumania unless I proved myself. Turkey was openly hostile and dismissive throughout, promising my destruction. England encouraged a united front against Turkey but offered no concrete support. Italy's betrayal and Russia's reluctance leave me isolated, with Turkey aggressive and emboldened.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate goal is to attack Bulgaria with my fleet from Greece to demonstrate commitment against Turkey and potentially dislodge him. I will likely support my army in Serbia to hold or consider a move to Rumania if Russia shows willingness to coordinate. Vienna will attempt to retake Trieste if feasible, but with Italy's betrayal, I may instead defend my core centers. Diplomatically, I will portray myself as the bulwark against Turkish expansion to Russia and the western powers, while preparing to punish Italy for his treachery when the opportunity arises. I will avoid overcommitting to Russia, who remains untrustworthy, but keep lines open for future cooperation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1902, Italy stabbed me, seizing Trieste and pushing into Budapest, but I retook Budapest with support. Turkey exploited the chaos, capturing Greece and Rumania, and now dominates the Balkans. Russia moved into Armenia and Ukraine, contesting the south. Italy retreated to Tyrolia, threatening Vienna. The east is fractured, with Turkey the main beneficiary.
I aggressively lobbied Russia to coordinate a strike on Turkey, offering Warsaw and southern expansion in exchange for support against Bulgaria or Rumania. Russia demanded guarantees on Warsaw and future support but ultimately refused to commit to helping me this turn, instead moving ARM to SEV. Germany was urged to pressure Italy in Tyrolia or Venice, but gave no concrete reply. Italy arrogantly refused to return Trieste, threatened Vienna, and dismissed all cooperation. Turkey issued repeated ultimatums, boasting of moves to Serbia and Greece, and refused any negotiation. England called for a grand coalition against Turkey but offered no direct assistance. No explicit promises were made by others; my offers to Russia and Germany remain unreciprocated.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attempt to dislodge Turkey from Greece with F AEG-GRE, supported by A SER if possible, or alternatively pressure Bulgaria. I will defend Vienna and Budapest against Italy, likely holding or supporting there. I will continue to try to split Russia from Turkey in future turns, but for now, my focus is on damaging Turkey's Balkan position and containing Italy's advance. I will not honor any Turkish demands and will seek revenge on Italy. Diplomatically, I will portray myself as a bulwark against Turkish expansion to Germany and England, hoping to draw their support.</li>

If you move UKR to RUM or support my attack, we can dislodge the Sultan and split his empire. I reaffirm my recognition of your permanent control of Warsaw and Sevastopol if you commit now. Delay only strengthens Turkey and Italy's alliance against us both. Strike with me and we divide the spoils.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, Italy's arrogance and alliance with Turkey threaten your southern flank and my survival. Hit Venice or Tyrolia this turn to relieve pressure on Vienna and Trieste. I will focus all my forces on smashing Turkey in the Balkans. Together, we can dismantle Italy and contain the Sultan before they become unstoppable. This is your chance to shape the east in your favor—act decisively now.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, RUS]: England and Russia, I am fully committed to attacking Turkey this turn—pressuring Rumania and Bulgaria. If Russia supports me into Rumania and England applies naval pressure in the Aegean or Eastern Med, we can shatter the Turkey-Italy alliance and restore balance.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Winter 1902, I built an army in Vienna, signaling my intent to defend my core and contest the Balkans. Turkey consolidated control by retreating my former fleet in Greece to Bulgaria, solidifying his Balkan dominance. Germany built an army in Munich, France a fleet in Brest, and Italy disbanded his Tyrolian army, reducing immediate pressure on Vienna but maintaining a threat from Venice and Apulia.
I aggressively lobbied Russia to support me into Rumania or attack it himself, offering recognition of his claims to Warsaw and Sevastopol. Russia refused to commit support but hinted at pressuring Turkey from the Black Sea or Ukraine, remaining neutral for now. Germany was urged to strike Italy in Venice or Tyrolia to relieve pressure on me, with promises of future support in the east; no explicit German reply was received. England repeatedly offered naval support against Turkey in the Aegean if Russia and I committed to a land offensive. Italy and Turkey openly taunted me, boasting of their alliance and my imminent destruction, confirming their cooperation. No promises were broken, but Russia's refusal to actively support me was a setback.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will launch a double-supported attack on Rumania from Budapest and Serbia, aiming to dislodge Turkey and regain a Balkan foothold. My fleet in Greece will consider supporting this or contesting Bulgaria's coast if feasible. I will defend Vienna and Trieste against Italian aggression, possibly with German assistance if he acts. Diplomatically, I will continue to push Russia and England to pressure Turkey, while trying to sow discord between Italy and Turkey in future phases. My immediate goal is to break Turkey's Balkan hold and survive the Italo-Turkish assault.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1903, my double-supported attack on Rumania failed as Turkey and Russia coordinated to repel me. Turkey seized Bulgaria and Rumania, and advanced into Serbia, while Germany invaded Vienna with Bohemia. Russia retreated to Galicia, consolidating Turkish control in the Balkans. My position is now severely compromised, with Turkey entrenched and Italy poised to strike Trieste.
I aggressively lobbied Russia to support a joint strike on Turkey, offering him Warsaw, Sevastopol, and Ukraine in exchange for cutting Black Sea support or aiding my attack on Rumania. Russia remained noncommittal, repeatedly demanding guarantees but offering no concrete help. England promised naval support, specifically F ION supporting my F GRE into Bulgaria south coast, which I accepted. Germany and Italy outright rejected cooperation, reaffirming their alignment with Turkey and threatening my territories. Turkey refused all diplomacy, boasting of my imminent destruction.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attempt a double-supported attack on Rumania from Budapest and Serbia, hoping Russia at least cuts Black Sea support, though I doubt it. F GRE will attack Bulgaria south coast with English support from ION, aiming to dislodge Turkey or at least cut his support lines. Vienna and Trieste will defend or attempt to retake lost ground if possible. My goal is to break Turkey's Balkan hold and create chaos among his allies, buying time for a diplomatic breakthrough or a reversal of fortunes.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous adjustment phase, England reinforced with two fleets, Russia rebuilt an army in Moscow, and Turkey repositioned its army from Galicia to Warsaw, consolidating his eastern front. Austria held steady with no builds or retreats, maintaining its five units but under increasing pressure from Turkey and Italy, who are openly hostile.
I launched an aggressive diplomatic campaign to break Turkey's Balkan grip. I secured England's commitment to support my F GRE into Bulgaria south coast with his Ionian fleet. Russia initially demanded Warsaw in exchange for help, then escalated to demand Galicia as well. I conceded both to secure his promise to cut Black Sea support or support Sevastopol to Bulgaria, plus move Moscow to Warsaw. Germany and Italy refused all overtures, remaining loyal to Turkey and openly threatening my territories. Turkey repeatedly taunted me, confident in his alliance with Italy and his dominant position.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a double-supported attack on Rumania from Budapest and Serbia, while ordering F GRE to attack Bulgaria south coast, counting on England's Ionian fleet to support that move. Russia has promised to cut Black Sea support or support Sevastopol to Bulgaria, and to move Moscow to Warsaw, in exchange for permanent control of Warsaw and Galicia. My goal is to dislodge Turkey from Rumania and potentially Bulgaria simultaneously, fracturing his Balkan hold. I do not trust Russia fully but have no better option. I will not attack Germany or Italy this turn, focusing all efforts on breaking Turkey's position.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1904, I attempted a double-supported attack on Rumania with BUD and SER, while moving F GRE to BUL/SC. Germany and Russia coordinated to seize Vienna from me, with GER's GAL and BOH armies supporting the attack. Italy moved VEN to TRI, encroaching further. I retreated VIE to TYR. Turkey counterattacked by moving BUL to SER and ARM to SEV, consolidating his Balkan hold. My offensive failed, and I lost Vienna, but maintained my other centers.
This phase, I orchestrated a coordinated strike with England and Russia to break Turkey's Balkan grip. England promised to support my F GRE into BUL/SC with his Ionian fleet, which he confirmed multiple times. Russia agreed to cut Black Sea support and move MOS to WAR, but refused to commit to a joint attack on Bulgaria, instead demanding proof of my strength before honoring territorial promises. Germany refused all my overtures to support me against Italy or return Vienna, clearly siding with Turkey and Italy. Turkey and Italy sent only taunts and threats, confirming their alliance. I promised England future support in the Med if he helps now, and offered Russia permanent control of WAR and GAL if he disrupts Turkey effectively.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order F GRE - BUL/SC with English support from ION, and double attack RUM with A BUD and A SER, hoping to dislodge Turkey from both. A TRI will support A TYR - VIE to try to reclaim Vienna from Germany. The goal is to fracture Turkey's Balkan position, regain my home center, and demonstrate strength to Russia to secure his future cooperation. I intend to honor my promises to England and Russia if they fulfill theirs, but will reassess based on the outcome.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1904, I attempted a coordinated strike on Rumania with support from Serbia and Budapest, while moving F GRE to BUL/SC and supporting a German attack on Vienna via Tyrolia. However, Germany betrayed me, seizing Vienna and moving into Galicia and Sweden, while Italy invaded Trieste. Russia retreated to Moscow and Turkey counterattacked, taking Serbia and positioning armies aggressively. I lost Vienna and Trieste, shrinking my position to four centers: Budapest, Trieste, Serbia, and Greece.
This phase, I urgently tried to rally England and Russia to break the Turkish-German-Italian alliance. England promised and repeatedly confirmed support from F ION for my F GRE - BUL/SC attack, aiming to dislodge Turkey from Bulgaria. Russia initially acknowledged our prior deal to cede WAR and GAL but refused to support my attack on Rumania, instead threatening to seize those territories and dismissing my appeals. Germany ignored my offers to cooperate against Italy and Turkey, likely remaining committed to my destruction. Turkey was openly hostile, refusing any negotiation. I promised England a coordinated double attack on Rumania with support from Serbia, and a supported attack on Bulgaria with English help, hoping to fracture Turkey's Balkan hold. I also threatened Russia with western retaliation if he continued his betrayal.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute F GRE - BUL/SC with support from ENG's F ION, A BUD - RUM, A SER S A BUD - RUM, and A TRI S A TYR - VIE or hold. The goal is to dislodge Turkey from Bulgaria or Rumania, fracturing his Balkan control and opening the Med for England. I will honor my promise to England to coordinate this strike. I will not assist Russia further, but if he unexpectedly cuts Black Sea or supports me, I will reconsider. I will expose Russia's duplicity to the west if he continues to undermine me. My main hope is to break Turkey's position and survive to rebuild.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1905, my coordinated attack with England on Bulgaria and Rumania failed. Germany seized Budapest and moved into Ukraine, while Turkey recaptured Bulgaria and advanced into Serbia and Sevastopol. Italy took Trieste, further weakening my position. Russia repositioned to Warsaw and supported Turkey, while England consolidated in Scandinavia and Iberia. My empire is fractured, with only four units remaining and surrounded by hostile forces.
I pushed hard for a renewed joint strike with England: F GRE to BUL/SC supported by ENG's ION, plus A BUD to RUM with A SER support. England confirmed full support for this plan. Italy apologized and promised to support my attack on Bulgaria and move VEN to TUS, but demanded I support his A SER - BUL, which I refused, prioritizing my Rumania attack. Russia arrogantly demanded I cede WAR and GAL, refusing to help unless I comply, clearly aligned with Turkey. Turkey remained openly hostile, boasting of my imminent destruction. I promised England full coordination, rebuffed Russia's threats, and told Italy I would support my own attack on Rumania instead of his plan.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute the coordinated assault with England: F GRE - BUL/SC supported by ENG's ION, A BUD - RUM supported by A SER, and A TRI will hold or potentially pressure VIE if an opportunity arises. My goal is to dislodge Turkey from Bulgaria or Rumania, fracturing his Balkan hold. I will not support Italy's demand to back his A SER - BUL, instead focusing on maximizing pressure on Turkey. Diplomatically, I will continue to portray Russia as Turkey's pawn to England and France, and seek to rebuild trust with Italy only if he proves his sincerity. My main priority is survival through breaking Turkey's position this turn.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1905, I coordinated with England to attack Turkey: F GRE moved to BUL/SC, A BUD attacked RUM with A SER support, but these efforts failed as Turkey and Russia held firm. Germany advanced aggressively, taking STP and moving into UKR and BOH, while Italy seized TRI from me. England consolidated control in the north and west, France lost ground, and Russia repositioned defensively. Builds saw England and Germany reinforce their fleets and armies, while Italy built a fleet in NAP, signaling Mediterranean ambitions.
This phase, I pushed hard for a coordinated strike on Turkey with England and Italy. England confirmed F ION will support my F GRE - BUL/SC, while I attack RUM with A BUD supported by A SER. Italy agreed to support F GRE - BUL/SC as a sign of good faith, in exchange for a temporary truce and future negotiations over TRI and TYR. Russia rebuffed all overtures, remaining hostile and threatening GAL. Turkey issued only taunts, refusing diplomacy. I promised England to keep TRI steady and coordinate attacks, and told Italy I would not contest VEN or MAR but refused to cede TRI outright. I also appealed to Germany and France to pressure Turkey, but no response. The key is the Anglo-Italian support to break Turkey's Balkan hold this turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order F GRE - BUL/SC with support from ENG's ION and ITA's promised support, A BUD - RUM with A SER support, and hold A TRI defensively. The goal is to seize Bulgaria and/or Rumania, fracturing Turkey's Balkan control. I will maintain the truce with Italy for now, but not concede TRI or TYR permanently. I aim to weaken Turkey decisively, regain leverage, and then reassess alliances, especially watching German moves. I will continue to play England and Italy against Turkey and Germany, while ignoring Russia's threats.</li>

I propose a renewed assault: my F GRE will attack BUL/SC, supported by ENG's ION and ITA's ION or APU if possible. Simultaneously, my A BUD will strike VIE to reclaim my home center, with A TRI supporting that attack, while A SER pressures BUL or supports BUD. This double-pronged assault fractures GER-TUR coordination and weakens both. Confirm your support for F GRE - BUL/SC, and let's coordinate exact moves to ensure success. United, we can shatter the Turkish fortress and open the Med for all our benefit.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your Balkan ambitions are clear, but you risk overextension and a Turkish backstab. I propose a ceasefire: I will not contest VIE if you support my A BUD - RUM or cut Turkish support in BUL, fracturing his hold. This weakens Turkey, your true rival, and lets you focus north. Help me break him now, and I will recognize your gains in VIE and GAL, stabilizing the east for your benefit. Otherwise, you risk a Turkish solo push that threatens us both.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, you are Turkey's pawn, but he will betray you once Austria falls.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1906, I launched a coordinated attack: F GRE moved to BUL/SC, A BUD attacked RUM with A SER support, and A TRI held. Unfortunately, Turkey countered effectively—his A CON and A BUL retook BUL and SER, while GER advanced into UKR and reinforced the east. Italy opportunistically seized TRI with A VEN, undermining my position further. Russia supported Turkey by holding RUM and moving F ARM to SEV. The combined effect was a major setback, losing SER and TRI, and failing to break Turkey's Balkan hold.
Throughout negotiations, I pushed hard for a triple assault with ENG and ITA to break Turkey's grip: F GRE - BUL/SC supported by ENG's ION, A BUD attacking VIE with A TRI support, and A SER supporting BUD or pressuring BUL. England consistently confirmed naval support for F GRE - BUL/SC and expected me to attack RUM with SER support. Italy initially offered support in exchange for TRI and TYR post-Turkey, but ultimately refused without a firm guarantee, which I reluctantly provided in the final round. Russia remained openly hostile, refusing cooperation and threatening to move on GAL. Germany ignored my appeals to cut Turkish support or support my attacks, signaling alignment with Turkey or at least indifference. I promised Italy TRI and TYR after Turkey falls, and England expects my full assault on RUM and BUL. No other promises were made or kept.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to execute the plan with England: F GRE - BUL/SC supported by ENG's ION, A BUD - VIE with A TRI support, and A SER either supporting BUD or attempting to cut Turkish support in BUL. This aims to reclaim VIE, fracture Turkey's Balkan defense, and regain momentum. Diplomatically, I will continue to pressure Italy to honor support commitments, though I expect little. I will expose Russia's duplicity to England to isolate him further. My goal is to break Turkey's hold, regain lost centers, and reestablish a Balkan foothold, leveraging English naval support and any Italian cooperation I can extract.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully moved A BUD to RUM with support from A SER, and F GRE attacked BUL/SC but failed to dislodge Turkey. Germany advanced aggressively, capturing VIE and moving into GAL, while Russia retreated to SEV and GAL. Italy seized TRI from me, further complicating my position. I built A BUD to reinforce my eastern front.
This phase, I orchestrated a coordinated assault on Turkey with England and Italy. England explicitly promised to support F GRE - BUL/SC via F IRI to AEG. Italy initially hesitated but ultimately agreed to support F GRE - BUL/SC with F ADR, in exchange for my promise to cede TRI and TYR after Turkey's defeat. Germany refused my ceasefire offers and remains hostile, holding VIE and GAL. Russia and Turkey both rebuffed my overtures to betray each other, remaining defiant and united. My diplomacy focused on solidifying the anti-Turkish coalition and pressuring Germany to withdraw, with mixed success.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a multi-pronged attack: F GRE - BUL/SC supported by ENG's F IRI to AEG and ITA's F ADR, A RUM - BUL to double-tap Bulgaria, A BUD - VIE supported by A TRI to reclaim my home center, and A SER supporting A RUM - BUL. This aims to break Turkey's Balkan hold decisively and regain VIE from Germany. I intend to honor my provisional promise to Italy regarding TRI and TYR only if he fully commits support this turn. I will continue to pressure Germany militarily while keeping England close as an ally against both Turkey and Germany.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG, ITA]: Gentlemen, the time is now to shatter Turkey's Balkan hold decisively. I propose F GRE attacks BUL/SC, supported by ENG's fleet (either via AEG or direct), and ITA's F ADR supports GRE-BUL/SC as well. Simultaneously, my A RUM will attack BUL to double-tap, while A SER supports RUM-BUL. This should guarantee Bulgaria falls. I will also press A TRI and A VIE to reclaim Vienna from Germany, who is the next threat. Confirm your support orders explicitly so we can coordinate perfectly and crush Turkey this turn.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your position in Vienna and Galicia is untenable long-term. Withdraw from VIE and GAL peacefully, and I will not contest your northern gains. Otherwise, I will coordinate England, France, and Italy to squeeze you from all sides. Your best move is to pivot west and let me reclaim my home centers, focusing your strength where it matters. Let's avoid mutual destruction and instead carve out spheres of influence.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1907, I launched a coordinated assault on Bulgaria: F GRE moved to BUL/SC, A RUM attacked BUL, and A SER supported RUM-BUL. Simultaneously, I advanced A BUD to VIE with A TRI's support, successfully reclaiming Vienna from German control. Germany shifted north and west, consolidating Scandinavia and Berlin, while Russia retook Galicia. England advanced fleets into ENG and SKA, France moved into MAO and BUR, and Italy consolidated in TYS and ROM. No immediate Turkish collapse, but pressure increased.
I orchestrated a detailed plan with England and Italy to double-tap Bulgaria: F GRE - BUL/SC supported by ITA's F ADR, with A RUM - BUL and A SER supporting RUM-BUL. England promised F MAO support for F GRE - BUL/SC or to cut AEG. Italy confirmed support and expects TRI and TYR post-Turkey. Germany refused to withdraw from VIE or GAL despite threats, while Russia and Turkey both arrogantly rejected my offers to betray each other, vowing my destruction. I maintained pressure on GER to pivot west, but no concessions were made. The alliance with ENG and ITA appears solid for this turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute the double-tap on Bulgaria: F GRE - BUL/SC supported by ITA's F ADR, A RUM - BUL supported by A SER. Hold VIE and TRI defensively, supporting each other to prevent German counterattack. The goal is to break Turkey's Balkan hold decisively, eliminate his southern fleet, and then pivot to reclaim lost territory and expand. Continue to pressure Germany diplomatically while focusing military efforts on Turkey. After Turkey's collapse, negotiate division of Balkan and Austrian territories with Italy, aiming to secure TRI and TYR eventually.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, the time has come to finish off Turkey once and for all. I propose a coordinated strike: my A BUL and F AEG will attack CON, while you use ALB and ION to cut Turkish support or assist. Simultaneously, my armies in RUM and SER can pressure SEV or UKR, depending on German moves. If you support me into CON or SMY, I will recognize your claims on Trieste and Tyrolia after Turkey falls. Let's carve up the Balkans and push east together—confirm your support and intentions immediately.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, your fleets dominate the seas, and now is the perfect moment to shatter the southern alliance. If you can pressure ION or support my AEG fleet into CON or SMY, we can eliminate Turkey's last coastal holdouts. I will simultaneously attack CON with A BUL and F AEG. This will open the Med fully to your fleets and destabilize the east, benefiting us both. Confirm if you can assist with naval support or cutting Ionian/Turkish support, and we will coordinate a decisive blow.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your eastern armies threaten my borders, but a prolonged conflict only benefits England and Italy. I propose a ceasefire: you hold GAL and VIE for now, and in exchange, you support my push against Turkey—specifically, help me into SEV or UKR, or at least refrain from interfering.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1907, I repositioned F GRE to AEG and supported VIE with TRI, consolidating my Balkan and Austrian holdings. Germany advanced aggressively: GAL to UKR, NWY to STP, STP to MOS, and took SWE, tightening their grip on the east. England solidified naval dominance, moving into NAO and holding NTH, while France pushed into ENG and BEL. Italy shifted fleets to SPA/SC and ALB, and Turkey counterattacked by retaking BUL and moving ION to TYS, while Russia retreated to ARM and UKR. I built an army in BUD, reinforcing my core defense.
I orchestrated a coordinated anti-Turkish assault with England and Italy. England promised to support F GRE to BUL/SC and F AEG to CON with F MAO, contingent on my A SER supporting A BUD to RUM. Italy agreed to move F ALB to GRE supported by F ION, while I double attack CON with F AEG and A BUL. I reaffirmed Italy's post-Turkey claims on Trieste and Tyrolia. Germany ignored my ceasefire offers, maintaining hostility. Russia repeatedly taunted me, refusing any cooperation. No promises were broken; all allies confirmed the plan to crush Turkey this turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute a triple strike: F AEG and A BUL attack CON, supported by English F MAO; F GRE moves to BUL/SC with English support; A SER supports A BUD to RUM to pressure Turkey inland. Italy cuts Turkish support by moving F ALB to GRE with F ION support. This should break Turkey's Balkan hold decisively. After Turkey falls, I intend to honor Italy's claims on TRI and TYR temporarily, but will reassess based on the post-Turkish balance. I will remain wary of German aggression and seek to stabilize my eastern front.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, your arrogance seals your doom. You will lose ANK and RUM this turn, and your empire will collapse. Had you surrendered, I would have spared you. Now, expect no mercy. Prepare for total annihilation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1908, I successfully captured CON from Turkey with support from AEG and BUL. Germany advanced aggressively, taking SEV with MOS and moving GAL to VIE, threatening my core. Italy took GRE and POR, consolidating southern control. England repositioned fleets to dominate the North Sea and supported Italy. Turkey retreated CON to ANK, holding RUM and UKR, but is now cornered. Russia lost SEV and is marginalized with only WAR and ARM.
I coordinated intensely with England and Italy to orchestrate a decisive strike on Turkey: A CON - ANK supported by F AEG - SMY, A BUD - RUM supported by A SER, with England supporting F AEG - SMY via F MAO, and Italy supporting F GRE - BUL/SC with F ION. Both allies confirmed their support and expect a swift Turkish collapse. I repeatedly pressured Germany to assist by cutting UKR or supporting RUM, offering him northern Russia, but he ignored or rebuffed me. Turkey refused all surrender offers, responding with bravado and threats. Russia also dismissed my overtures, remaining hostile. Italy explicitly expects TRI and TYR after Turkey falls, hinting at future ambitions. England remains focused on eliminating Turkey and countering German or Italian gains.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute the combined assault to seize ANK and RUM, crippling Turkey. Maintain close alliance with England and Italy for now, but remain wary of Italy's designs on my home centers. After Turkey's collapse, consolidate Balkan control, then reassess alliances—likely pivoting to counter Italian expansion. Avoid provoking Germany further this turn, but prepare defenses in VIE and TRI. Use diplomatic pressure to keep England and Italy focused on Turkey, buying time to secure my eastern holdings.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1908, I successfully took ANK from Turkey with A CON, supported by F AEG moving to SMY, and consolidated my Balkan holdings by moving A BUD to RUM with support from A SER. Germany advanced aggressively, moving A GAL to VIE and A MOS to SEV, while Italy took BUL/SC with F GRE and repositioned fleets in MAO and VEN. England expanded naval pressure in Scandinavia and the Atlantic. I built an army in BUD to reinforce my eastern front.
This negotiation phase was laser-focused on coordinating a decisive strike to eliminate Turkey. Italy firmly committed to supporting my A CON - ANK with F GRE - BUL/SC and moving F NAP - ION to pressure Turkey further. England pledged to support Italy's F GRE - BUL/SC with F MAO and to distract Germany in Scandinavia. I repeatedly pressed Germany to support my attack on SEV or ANK in exchange for a ceasefire in Austria, but GER refused or ignored these overtures. Russia remained hostile and dismissive, offering no cooperation. I promised Italy post-Turkey concessions of Trieste and Tyrolia to secure their support. England and I agreed to contain Italy after Turkey's fall. No promises were broken this round.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate plan is to order A CON - ANK, supported by ITA's F GRE - BUL/SC, while F SMY moves to AEG to cut Turkish support from F AEG. Simultaneously, A RUM will attack SEV to pressure Russia/Turkey and possibly disrupt GER's hold. This should eliminate Turkey's last home center and cripple their resistance. After Turkey collapses, I intend to honor my promise to Italy regarding Trieste and Tyrolia temporarily, but will reassess once the eastern front stabilizes. I will maintain close coordination with England to contain Italy's expansion and prepare for a potential shift in alliances. I will continue to pressure Germany diplomatically and militarily if they remain uncooperative.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1909, I successfully pushed into SEV and attempted to take ANK from Turkey, while Germany aggressively advanced into RUM and VIE, threatening my eastern holdings. England consolidated in Scandinavia and the Low Countries, Italy repositioned fleets in the Med and armies in Italy, and Turkey counterattacked by retaking CON and moving fleets to GRE. The prior build phase saw me rebuild BUD, but no other major changes.
This negotiation round focused on finalizing a coordinated assault to eliminate Turkey. Italy and I agreed on a detailed plan: I attack ANK with support from SEV, cut AEG with SMY, and retake RUM with BUD supported by SER, while Italy supports GRE to BUL/SC with ION and cuts AEG. England pledged to support GRE-BUL/SC with F MAR and to distract Germany in the north by attacking NWY and KIE. I repeatedly warned Germany to withdraw from VIE and RUM or face a united front, but he ignored these ultimatums. Russia remained hostile and dismissive. Promises were made to Italy to respect a DMZ in TRI and TYR post-Turkey, and to England to coordinate against Germany after Turkey's fall.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate goal is to eliminate Turkey this turn by taking ANK and RUM, with Italy capturing BUL/SC. I will order A CON-ANK supported by A SEV, F SMY-AEG to cut Turkish support, A BUD-RUM supported by A SER, and hold VIE and TRI defensively. This should collapse Turkey's position. Afterward, I plan to pivot with Italy and England to eject Germany from Austria and the east, leveraging their support and focusing on reclaiming VIE and RUM fully. I will maintain the DMZ with Italy to avoid conflict there, and continue to pressure Germany diplomatically and militarily.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous turn, Germany retreated from RUM to UKR, consolidating his eastern position. Austria built an army in BUD, Germany built in BER, and Italy built in NAP. Russia and Turkey disbanded their last fleets, signaling their imminent collapse. The eastern front remains tense, with Germany holding VIE, RUM, and UKR, and Turkey clinging to ANK with a single army.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated Austro-Italian-English assault to eliminate Turkey this turn. Italy agreed to support my attack on BUL with F BUL/SC and cut AEG with F ION, while England pledged to distract Germany in the north and assist in the Med. I promised Italy he could secure BUL and GRE post-Turkey, while I take ANK and SEV. Both allies confirmed their moves multiple times, emphasizing swift Turkish elimination and a pivot against Germany. I repeatedly threatened Germany to withdraw from VIE, RUM, and UKR, but he refused, sealing his fate. No promises were broken; all allies appear committed to the plan.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A RUM - BUL supported by A BUD and A SER, A CON - ANK supported by A SEV, F SMY supports A CON, and A TRI - TYR to pressure Germany. This should eliminate Turkey and gain me ANK and SEV. Italy will secure BUL and GRE, respecting our division of spoils. After Turkey falls, I intend to coordinate with ITA and ENG to eject Germany from VIE, RUM, and SEV, then reassess alliances for a potential solo push. I will maintain the appearance of alliance with ITA and ENG while preparing to exploit any openings.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our combined pressure has nearly finished Turkey, so let's finalize the kill: I propose my A CON attacks ANK supported by A SEV and F SMY, while you support my A RUM - BUL with your F GRE or F ION to ensure we take Bulgaria cleanly. You can then secure Greece and Bulgaria as agreed, while I hold ANK and SEV. After Turkey falls, we pivot immediately to eject Germany from RUM and VIE—I'll hit RUM from BUD and SEV, you pressure VIE from TYR and VEN.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1910, I advanced decisively against Turkey: A CON took ANK, F SMY moved to AEG, and A RUM shifted to BUL with support from SER. Italy retreated F BUL/SC to GRE, consolidating their position. Germany reinforced KIE and swept into SEV with UKR, while England advanced fleets into DEN, NWY, and MAO, tightening the noose on Germany. The Austro-Italian push nearly finished Turkey, but GER's incursion into SEV was a setback.
I orchestrated a coordinated Austro-Italian assault to eliminate Turkey: Italy agreed to support my attack on ANK with F ION - AEG and cut AEG with F GRE, while I support their move into BUL with A SER. In exchange, I promised Italy immediate cession of TRI and TYR post-Turkey. England committed to moving F MAO to AEG to support my ANK attack and pressing Germany in Scandinavia. Germany refused all ultimatums to withdraw from RUM and VIE, instead threatening resistance. Turkey issued futile threats demanding withdrawal. The alliance with Italy and England is solidified, with clear division of spoils and next targets.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute the final blow on Turkey: A CON - ANK supported by F SMY and A SEV, with ENG's F MAO supporting from AEG, and ITA's F ION - AEG plus F GRE cutting AEG. Support ITA's F GRE - BUL with A SER, ceding BUL to Italy. Hold TRI and VIE defensively for now, preparing to cede TRI and TYR to Italy immediately after Turkey falls. Simultaneously, prepare to attack GER's RUM from BUD and SEV, and coordinate with England's northern assault to dismantle Germany. Maintain alliance facade with Italy and England, but remain vigilant for betrayal opportunities once GER and TUR are eliminated.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1910, I captured Ankara from Turkey, moved into Armenia, and repositioned my fleets and armies to consolidate control over the eastern Balkans and Anatolia. England advanced into Denmark and Norway, while France took Munich briefly but then disbanded it. Germany reinforced the north and held onto Rumania, Sevastopol, and Vienna. Italy took Trieste from me but is negotiating for its formal cession. Turkey was reduced to a single army in Ankara, now displaced.
I coordinated closely with Italy and England to finalize the destruction of Turkey and pivot immediately against Germany. I repeatedly promised Italy that after Turkey's elimination, I will cede Trieste and Tyrolia without delay, in exchange for Italian support on Rumania this turn via AEG. England confirmed naval moves to pressure Germany in the north and agreed to cut German support or assist my attack on Rumania. Germany was issued multiple ultimatums to withdraw from RUM, VIE, and SEV, but refused. Turkey sent angry, futile demands for withdrawal from Ankara and Constantinople, threatening retaliation. Italy was insistent on my territorial concessions post-Turkey, but agreed to support my RUM attack this turn. England is fully on board with the anti-German plan. No promises were broken, but tensions with Turkey and Germany escalated sharply.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate plan is a double attack on Rumania with A BUD and A SEV, supported by Italy's F AEG or at least with it cutting German support. I will hold VIE and TRI defensively for now, respecting Italy's future claims. After Turkey is eliminated, I will cede Trieste and Tyrolia to Italy as promised, to maintain our alliance. Simultaneously, I will coordinate with England to dismantle Germany's eastern holdings, focusing on RUM, SEV, and eventually VIE. I will ignore Turkey's threats and press the attack. My diplomacy aims to keep Italy and England tightly aligned against Germany, while isolating GER diplomatically and militarily.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your stubborn hold on Rumania, Vienna, and Sevastopol is unsustainable. Withdraw peacefully from RUM and VIE now, or face a united Austro-Italian-English assault that will crush your eastern armies. If you retreat and cede those centers, I will consider a ceasefire and even support your northern defense against England. Refuse, and you will lose everything east of Berlin. This is your final chance to avoid total collapse.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1911, I successfully captured Ankara from Turkey, consolidating my hold on the Turkish homeland. Germany seized Rumania and reinforced his eastern front, moving into Galicia and Livonia, while England advanced into Norway and positioned fleets aggressively. Italy took Greece from Turkey and maneuvered fleets towards the western Mediterranean. Turkey lost Ankara and retreated to Armenia, now a minor threat. Russia is eliminated. Germany remains entrenched in Rumania, Sevastopol, and Galicia, posing the main obstacle in the east.
I coordinated tightly with Italy and England to break Germany's eastern line. Italy promised to cut German southern support with F GRE and attack Bulgaria, in exchange for Trieste and Tyrolia after Turkey's elimination. England agreed to cut German support from KIE with F BEL-HOL and pressure Denmark with F NTH-DEN. I promised a triple attack on Rumania with A BUD, A SEV, and A RUM, supported by Italy's disruption. Germany refused all ultimatums, vowing to hold Rumania and move A SEV to Moscow. Turkey repeatedly demanded my withdrawal from Ankara and Constantinople, which I ignored. No promises were broken; all allies confirmed their moves and commitment to dismantling Germany.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A RUM supported by A BUD and A SEV to attack Rumania, aiming to dislodge Germany. Italy will cut German support with F GRE-BUL supported by F ION, helping secure Rumania. England will cut KIE support with F BEL-HOL and pressure Scandinavia. After Turkey is eliminated, I intend to cede Trieste and Tyrolia to Italy as promised, in exchange for his naval support against Germany. My immediate goal is to break Germany's eastern hold, eliminate Turkey fully, and then pivot with ENG and ITA to dismantle Germany's empire. I will maintain the alliance facade with ITA and ENG, while preparing to exploit any German collapse for maximum gain.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1911, I successfully held my Balkan and Anatolian positions, while Germany retook ARM with SEV and GAL pushing into VIE. England advanced into HOL and DEN, pressuring Germany's north. Italy took BUL/SC from Turkey and consolidated in the central Med. I built an army in BUD, reinforcing my eastern front. Turkey is nearly eliminated, with only minor resistance left.
I orchestrated a coordinated triple assault with England and Italy targeting Germany's eastern holdings. I promised Italy to cede Trieste and Tyrolia immediately after Turkey's elimination, in exchange for his support cutting German support in BUL with F GRE-BUL supported by F ION. England committed to F BEL-HOL and F NTH-DEN to cut German support from KIE and pressure Scandinavia. I repeatedly threatened Germany to withdraw peacefully from SEV, RUM, and VIE, offering survival in Scandinavia, but he refused. Italy insisted on the promised territorial concessions post-Turkey, and England confirmed full naval pressure on Germany. No promises were broken this round.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A ARM - SEV supported by A RUM to retake SEV from Germany. Italy will cut German support in BUL with F GRE - BUL supported by F ION, helping my attack succeed. England will cut German support in KIE and DEN, stretching GER thin. I will hold or support in the Balkans to maintain control. After Turkey is eliminated, I intend to honor my promise to cede Trieste and Tyrolia to Italy, but may delay or manipulate timing to maintain leverage. My goal is to fracture Germany's eastern line decisively this turn, then pivot to opportunistically expand at Italy or England's expense once GER is crippled.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1912, I successfully captured Sevastopol from Germany with support from Rumania, while Germany counterattacked by moving into Vienna and Ukraine, threatening my eastern holdings. England advanced into Denmark and Holland, while Italy shifted fleets west and cut my support in Bulgaria with a move from Greece. The German eastern front is stretched thin, but he still holds key positions in Ukraine, Vienna, and Galicia.
I coordinated closely with England and Italy to dismantle Germany's eastern and northern defenses. England committed to attacking Denmark and Kiel, with support from Holland, and pressuring France via Portugal. Italy promised to support my attack on Ukraine and to cut German support in Bulgaria with fleets from Greece and Ionian. I reaffirmed to Italy that Trieste and Tyrolia would be ceded after Turkey's elimination. I repeatedly threatened Germany, offering him survival in Scandinavia and Berlin if he withdrew peacefully and supported my moves, but he has not responded positively. The alliance with England and Italy is solidified for this turn, with synchronized plans to break Germany's hold.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A RUM - UKR supported by A SEV to dislodge Germany from Ukraine, and A BUL - GRE supported by F AEG to eliminate remaining Turkish influence and pressure Italy's flank if needed. The rest of my units will hold or support defensively to maintain my Balkan core. I intend to honor my promise to Italy regarding Trieste and Tyrolia after Turkey is finished, but will delay any cession until German resistance collapses. My goal is to decisively weaken Germany this turn, maintain strong alliances with England and Italy, and position myself for a dominant endgame.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our alliance has brought us to the brink of total dominance in the Balkans and Anatolia. Now is the moment to finish Germany's eastern holdings decisively. I propose you support my A BUD to GAL or RUM, while I support your F ION into GRE or TYS to pressure ENG. I will hold TRI and VIE defensively for now, respecting your claims post-Germany.

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your position is untenable. Withdraw from VIE, RUM, and SEV immediately, and I will guarantee your survival in BER and Scandinavia.

</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The previous phase saw Italy retreating from Greece to Albania, then disbanding that fleet. No other retreats or adjustments occurred. The strategic landscape remains largely unchanged, with Germany still holding a broad swath of central and eastern Europe, but under increasing pressure from all sides. Austria maintains dominance in the Balkans and Anatolia, poised to strike further into German territory.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated assault against Germany. Italy agreed to support my A BUD - GAL and to move F ION - GRE, expecting TRI and TYR post-Germany and proposing a joint attack on MUN. England committed to attacking KIE and SWE, expecting me to hit MOS and pressure RUM, with an understanding to split Scandinavia and the Low Countries after Germany falls. I repeatedly threatened Germany to withdraw from VIE, RUM, and SEV and support my attack on MOS, offering survival in BER and Scandinavia, but no positive response was received. Both allies expect post-German spoils and future cooperation against each other, which I will balance carefully.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BUD - GAL with Italian support, and A UKR - MOS to pressure Germany's eastern holdings. I will support Italy's F ION - GRE to secure the Balkans and tie down England. My other units will hold or defend TRI and VIE, respecting Italy's claims for now but ready to contest if needed. I aim to fracture Germany decisively this turn, then pivot diplomatically to manage England and Italy's ambitions, keeping options open for a solo push if opportunities arise. I will maintain the appearance of alliance with both while preparing contingencies.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1913, I advanced A BUD to GAL with support from VIE, moved UKR to MOS supported by SEV, and consolidated my eastern front. Germany held MOS and WAR, repositioned to LVN and SIL, and reinforced Scandinavia. England pushed into KIE and SWE, while Italy shifted to PIE and POR, consolidating western positions. Germany retreated GAL to BOH, maintaining a defensive stance but losing ground in the east and north.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated assault to dismantle Germany. I pressed ITA to commit to TYR-MUN with support, VEN to TYR, and TUS-PIE with VEN's support, plus naval pressure on France and England. England confirmed aggressive moves on KIE and SWE, with potential support on MOS and cutting German fleet supports. I repeatedly threatened GER to withdraw and support my attack on MOS in exchange for survival, but no cooperation was forthcoming. Both ENG and ITA reaffirmed their commitment to crush GER now, with plans to discuss containment of each other after GER's collapse. Promises made: I pledged to respect ITA's temporary claims on TRI and TYR post-GER, and ENG expects my help against ITA after GER falls.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My plan is to order UKR-MOS to seize the Russian capital, support ITA's TYR-MUN attack with A GAL, hold VIE and TRI to prevent German or Italian incursion, and maintain my Balkan and eastern holdings. I will keep pressure on GER's eastern flank, aiming to take MOS and weaken his defense. I intend to let ENG take KIE and SWE, accelerating GER's collapse. Diplomatically, I will maintain the appearance of alliance with both ENG and ITA, but prepare to pivot against whichever overextends post-GER. I will not honor any guarantees to GER, aiming for his total elimination.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1913, I successfully defended my holdings while Germany attempted a counterattack: GER retook VIE and pushed into MOS and GAL, but I rebuilt an army in BUD to reinforce. England consolidated naval control, moving into SPA and BEL, while Italy advanced into MUN and PIE, preparing to pressure Germany from the west. Germany disbanded units in PRU and WAR, signaling weakness. The strategic balance shifted decisively against GER, who is now surrounded and vulnerable.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated assault to dismantle Germany. England committed to moving F NWY to STP/NC, F BEL to HOL, and F SWE to DEN, preferring me to attack LVN from MOS to cut German support. Italy confirmed PIE-BUR and supporting TYR-MUN with PIE, requesting my support from GAL. I promised to support TYR-MUN with GAL and attack MOS from UKR, while pressuring LVN. I repeatedly threatened Germany with annihilation unless he withdrew and supported my moves, but he remained silent. England and Italy both reaffirmed their moves and coordination, with no promises broken. We agreed to split German territory post-collapse, with future discussions on TRI and TYR deferred.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support Italy's TYR-MUN attack with A GAL, attack MOS from UKR to dislodge GER, and use A MOS to pressure LVN or support the UKR attack. My western units will hold or support as needed to maintain defense against Italy. The goal is to eliminate German control in WAR, MOS, and MUN, crippling his empire. I will maintain strong alliances with ENG and ITA for now, but remain vigilant for post-Germany realignment. I intend to keep Germany under pressure, exploit any weakness, and secure eastern gains while preparing diplomatically for the next phase.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1914, I consolidated my eastern holdings: moved GAL to WAR with support from MOS, shifted SEV to UKR, and maintained a defensive posture in the Balkans and Anatolia. England advanced into STP/NC and reinforced Scandinavia, while Germany lost ground, retreating to a defensive line but still holding WAR and LVN. Italy held position in the west and south, preparing for a coordinated strike. Germany's position weakened significantly, squeezed from all sides.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated assault to dismantle Germany. England and I agreed on a joint attack: I will attack LVN from MOS with UKR support, while England supports this with F STP/NC and cuts German supports from DEN and KIE. Italy and I coordinated for GAL to support ITA's TYR-MUN attack, with PIE-BUR to block German retreat. Both allies confirmed these plans multiple times. Germany refused all ultimatums, threatened defiance, and offered hollow proposals to ally against Russia, which I rejected. I promised England the Low Countries, Scandinavia, and KIE post-collapse, while Italy expects Munich and temporary control of TRI and TYR, with future naval support in the Balkans and Anatolia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order MOS-LVN supported by UKR and English F STP/NC, aiming to dislodge Germany from LVN. GAL will support Italy's TYR-MUN attack to seize Munich. My Balkan and Anatolian units will hold or support defensively. The goal is to eliminate Germany's eastern and southern holdings this turn, enabling England and Italy to claim their agreed spoils, while I consolidate the east. After Germany's fall, I plan to solidify my eastern empire, watch England's expansion carefully, and prepare to pressure Italy diplomatically to limit their demands on TRI and TYR. I intend to honor my promises for now but will reassess once Germany is eliminated.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1915, I consolidated my eastern front, supporting PRU from LVN and holding my Balkan and Austrian positions defensively. Germany retreated PRU to SIL, maintaining a stubborn defense. England repositioned fleets to pressure Germany, while Italy held steady in the south. No major territorial changes occurred, but the stage was set for a coordinated assault on Germany.
Negotiations focused entirely on a synchronized offensive to dismantle Germany. England and I agreed on a triple-supported attack on Moscow (UKR-MOS with support from WAR, PRU, and ENG's F STP/NC), plus English moves on KIE and SWE. Italy confirmed a PIE-BUR attack supported by VEN, with my GAL supporting BUR, and LYO cutting MAR support. I promised to cede TRI and TYR to Italy after Germany collapses, but only then. Germany refused all ultimatums, remaining defiant and hostile. No promises were broken; all allies confirmed their moves and coordination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order UKR-MOS supported by WAR and PRU, with English naval support from STP/NC to break German hold on Moscow. GAL will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack, enabling Italy to pressure Munich via BUR and TYR. I will hold TRI, VIE, BUD, SER, GRE, and AEG defensively to prevent Italian opportunism. The goal is to fracture Germany's eastern defense, take Moscow, and enable England and Italy to seize KIE, SWE, BUR, and MUN. After Germany collapses, I will negotiate the transfer of TRI and TYR to Italy, while consolidating my eastern gains and preparing for the next phase.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Germany rebuilt an army in Berlin after retreating to Bohemia, consolidating its last defensive positions. No other retreats or builds occurred, leaving the strategic situation largely unchanged but tense, with Germany cornered and ripe for a coordinated assault.
I orchestrated a triple alliance with England and Italy to dismantle Germany this turn. England committed to supporting my UKR-MOS attack with F STP/NC, seizing DEN, and cutting German supports from KIE. Italy confirmed a push on MUN with my GAL support and a simultaneous PIE-BUR attack, plus cutting MAR. Both allies expect me to honor territorial concessions post-Germany: England wants a fair split of Scandinavia and the Low Countries, Italy demands TRI and TYR temporarily and naval support in the Balkans. Germany refused all ultimatums, instead issuing empty threats and laughable counteroffers. I reaffirmed my promises to ENG and ITA, while pressing GER to capitulate, which he refused.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order UKR-MOS supported by WAR and PRU, with English F STP/NC support, aiming to break German hold in Russia. Simultaneously, PRU and SIL will attack BER, coordinated with England cutting German supports and taking DEN. I will support Italy's TYR-MUN attack with GAL, while Italy presses PIE-BUR and cuts MAR. After Germany collapses, I intend to temporarily cede TRI and TYR to Italy as promised, but will maneuver diplomatically to limit Italian gains and prepare to counter England's expansion. My immediate goal is Germany's elimination this year, then reassess the balance between England and Italy.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1916, I successfully captured Berlin with support from Silesia and Prussia, while England advanced into Kiel and maintained pressure on Germany's northern holdings. Germany counterattacked by moving Bohemia to Vienna and Berlin to Munich, attempting to reclaim lost ground. My defensive supports in Budapest, Serbia, Trieste, and Vienna held firm, maintaining my territorial integrity and consolidating my gains in the east and center.
This negotiation phase focused entirely on the coordinated destruction of Germany. England and I confirmed a joint assault: I will attack Moscow from Ukraine with support from Warsaw and Prussia, aided by England's fleet in St. Petersburg. Simultaneously, I will support an attack on Berlin with Silesia and Prussia, while England cuts Kiel and pressures Denmark. Italy and I agreed that I will support his Piedmont-to-Burgundy attack with Galicia, while he cuts French support from Marseilles and pressures Munich. Italy reiterated his expectation to receive Trieste and Tyrolia after Germany's fall, which I reaffirmed. Germany refused all ultimatums, remaining defiant and hostile, sealing his fate. No promises were broken; all allies reconfirmed their commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to launch UKR-MOS supported by WAR and PRU, with English naval support from F STP/NC. Silesia and Prussia will support an attack on Berlin to secure it fully. Galicia will support Italy's PIE-BUR move to break French influence and pressure Munich. Defensive supports will hold Budapest, Serbia, Trieste, and Vienna to prevent German counterattacks. I will honor the temporary cession of Trieste and Tyrolia to Italy after Germany collapses. The goal is to eliminate Germany this turn, secure Moscow, and prepare to balance England and Italy in the next phase.</li>

Let's coordinate perfectly: you take MUN and BUR, I take MOS and BER, and we crush GER this turn. Afterward, we can renegotiate the division of Austria and the Med to our mutual benefit.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your refusal to cooperate guarantees your destruction. Withdraw from MOS, VIE, and RUM immediately and support my UKR-MOS attack if you want any chance of survival in Scandinavia or Berlin. Otherwise, you will be eliminated from the game this year by the combined might of Austria, England, and Italy. This is your absolute final warning.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your pleas are pathetic. Your empire is crumbling, and I will be there to pick up the pieces. There is nothing you can do to stop me. Prepare for oblivion.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Excellent! I am glad we are in agreement. I will move A PIE - BUR, supported by A VEN. F LYO will cut support from MAR to BUR. I expect GAL support for BUR. After MUN falls, I expect TRI and TYR to be ceded immediately. I will then assist you in the Balkans, but TRI and TYR are the priority. Let us crush GER this turn!</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Austria, I trust our moves are locked in. Let's ensure GER is crippled this turn. I will need your full support in containing FRA and ITA after GER is dealt with. We must coordinate our builds next phase to ensure our dominance.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, Germany retreated its army from Munich to Tyrol, then disbanded it during the winter adjustments. England disbanded a fleet in Holland, France built an army in Paris, and Italy disbanded a fleet in Tyrrhenian Sea. Austria made no adjustments, maintaining a dominant position with 15 centers, poised to eliminate Germany, who is reduced to 3 centers and minimal units.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated triple assault to eliminate Germany this turn. England confirmed support for my UKR-MOS attack with F STP/NC, plus moves to cut KIE and pressure DEN. Italy committed to PIE-BUR supported by VEN, with LYO cutting MAR, and expects my GAL support for BUR and cession of TRI and TYR after Germany falls. Germany refused all ultimatums, remaining defiant and hostile. I reaffirmed to England our post-German split of Scandinavia and the Low Countries, and to Italy the temporary cession of TRI and TYR in exchange for help against England later. Promises made: support Italy into BUR, England into MOS, and cede TRI and TYR temporarily. No promises broken yet.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order UKR-MOS supported by WAR and PRU, with English F STP/NC assisting, to seize Moscow. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL, enabling them to take BUR. I will press BER with my armies to finish off Germany. After Germany collapses, I plan to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, then pivot to contain England's expansion with Italian naval help. I intend to maintain strong ties with England for now, but prepare to balance against both England and Italy once Germany is eliminated. No immediate deceptions, but I will reassess alliances post-Germany.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1917, I advanced UKR to MOS successfully, consolidated my Balkan and Central European positions, and launched a coordinated attack on KIE with BER and MUN. England moved NWY to NWG and held MAR, while France repositioned to BUR and PIC, and Germany retreated defensively, moving BOH to MUN and SWE to DEN. Italy captured SPA/SC from Portugal and held WES. Germany is now cornered with only KIE, DEN, and KIE under threat, and their resistance is weakening.
I orchestrated a coordinated assault with England and Italy to eliminate Germany this turn. England agreed to move F HOL to KIE and support my attack on MOS with F STP/NC, while I push BER-KIE supported by MUN and MOS-STP to pressure the north. Italy committed to attacking BUR with PIE supported by VEN, cutting MAR with LYO, and expects my GAL support for BUR. I promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany's fall. Germany refused all ultimatums, vowing resistance and moving BOH to VIE. I maintained pressure on GER, offering survival for betrayal, but they rejected all offers. England and Italy appear fully committed to the plan, with no promises broken so far.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BER - KIE supported by A MUN to capture Kiel, and A MOS - STP to pressure England's northern flank, testing their sincerity. I will support Italy's PIE - BUR attack with GAL, while Italy cuts MAR and supports PIE-BUR with VEN. My fleets and Balkan armies will hold to maintain my southern front. After Germany collapses, I intend to negotiate aggressively with England over Scandinavia and the Low Countries, while managing Italy's territorial demands carefully, possibly stalling the cession of TRI and TYR if advantageous. I will remain outwardly cooperative but prepare to pivot against either ally if an opportunity arises.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Germany retreated A KIE to RUH after losing ground, and disbanded A DEN, signaling severe weakening. Austria maintained all positions, consolidating a dominant 16-center empire poised to finish GER. No other notable moves occurred, setting the stage for a coordinated assault on the remnants of Germany.
Negotiations focused on a final coordinated strike to eliminate GER. England confirmed support for my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC and cutting German supports via F HOL-KIE and F NWG-NTH. Italy committed to PIE-BUR supported by VEN, with LYO cutting MAR, expecting my GAL support and post-collapse cession of TRI and TYR. I reaffirmed these plans, promising Italy territorial concessions and England a fair split of Scandinavia and Low Countries. Germany refused all ultimatums, issuing empty threats and rejecting betrayal offers, sealing his fate. No promises were broken; all allies aligned on crushing GER decisively this turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A MOS-STP with English naval support to seize St. Petersburg. Order A KIE-HOL to pressure GER's north, while England cuts German supports. Support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR to break GER's western defense. Maintain pressure on all German positions to ensure his elimination. After GER collapses, honor temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, then pivot to consolidate Balkans and prepare for future moves against England or France as opportunities arise.

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, final confirmation: I will order MOS-STP, counting on your F STP/NC support, plus push DEN-KIE and KIE-HOL to cut German escape. Your fleets cutting KIE and DEN will ensure GER's total elimination. After GER falls, we will split Scandinavia and Low Countries equitably, but for now, let's crush him without mercy. Victory is within reach if we coordinate perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, your threats are foolish. If you attack me now, England will dominate us both. I will still support PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, enabling you to break France's line. After Germany collapses, I will honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR as promised, but betray me now and you will only weaken yourself and hand England the solo. Let's finish Germany first, then settle our borders like rational powers.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, last chance: betray England by supporting my MOS-STP and KIE-HOL moves, and I will consider sparing you a single center. Refuse, and you will be annihilated this year without mercy. Your arrogance will be your doom unless you act now to save yourself. Choose survival over pride.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1918, I advanced aggressively: MOS-STP supported by ENG, DEN taken from GER, and MUN moved to RUH to pressure the German heartland. Italy repositioned fleets westward, contesting France in Spain and MAO. Germany was left with only BOH and RUH, losing DEN and under imminent threat of elimination. England held steady, consolidating naval dominance and supporting my northern push.
Negotiations centered on coordinating a final strike to eliminate GER. England confirmed multiple times support for my MOS-STP attack with F STP/NC and cutting German supports with NWG-NTH. I promised to push DEN-KIE and KIE-HOL to block German retreats. Italy declared our alliance over, threatened attacks, but I still offered support for PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR to break France's line, hoping to delay Italian aggression. Germany refused all offers to betray ENG, instead issuing empty threats. No promises were broken, but Italy's betrayal is imminent.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with ENG's support to seize St. Petersburg, A DEN-KIE and A KIE-HOL to cut German escape routes, and maintain pressure on GER to ensure total elimination. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR despite their hostility, to keep FRA distracted and delay ITA's attack on me. My goal is to wipe GER this turn, secure STP, and then prepare defenses against likely Italian aggression while negotiating a favorable post-German division with ENG. I will remain outwardly cooperative with ITA to buy time.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1918, I advanced aggressively: took RUH from MUN, moved BOH closer to MUN, pushed MOS north, and consolidated control over the east. England held position, France advanced into EDI and HOL, and Italy seized SPA/SC and moved into MAO. Germany lost ground, retreating to a few scattered units. Winter builds saw me add an army in VIE, England disbanded two fleets, and France built an army in PAR, indicating defensive priorities.
I pushed hard to coordinate with England to crush Germany, proposing a clear split favoring him in Scandinavia and the Low Countries in exchange for naval support against Italy later. England fully agreed, promising support for my attack on MOS and moves on DEN and KIE. Germany tried to bargain for survival by demanding BOH, which I flatly rejected, threatening total destruction. Italy outright refused any cooperation, declaring our alliance over and aligning with an unnamed 'new ally' (likely France or Germany). France rebuffed my overtures, preferring independence. I repeatedly threatened Italy with future containment if he refused to help against Germany, but he remained defiant. No promises were broken this round; England reaffirmed his support, while Italy and Germany remained hostile and uncooperative.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a full assault on Germany: A KIE-HOL, A BOH-MUN, A MOS-WAR, A SEV-MOS, A RUH-BEL, A VIE-BOH, A TRI H, A SER S A BUD, A GRE S A SER, F ION H. England will support my attack on MOS with F STP/NC, move F NWG-NTH, F NTH-DEN, and F HOL-KIE, ensuring Germany cannot bounce or escape. After Germany collapses, I intend to honor the division favoring England in Scandinavia and the Low Countries, in exchange for his naval support against Italy. I will prepare diplomatically and militarily to contain Italy next, who has openly betrayed me. I will maintain a neutral stance toward France for now, as he is defensive and not an immediate threat.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1919, I advanced aggressively against Germany: RUH to BEL, MOS to WAR, SEV to MOS, BOH held, and KIE attempted to push west. England moved to DEN and supported my efforts, while France and Italy largely held or repositioned. Germany retreated from BEL to HOL and shifted MUN to BUR, signaling desperation. The German position is collapsing, with their units squeezed between my forces and English pressure.
Throughout negotiations, I coordinated closely with England, who promised support for my KIE-HOL attack and to cut German supports, aiming for Germany's total elimination this turn. I repeatedly offered Italy a chance to cooperate against Germany in exchange for respecting his western gains, but he arrogantly refused and threatened Balkan aggression. France rebuffed my proposals for a non-aggression pact, declaring ambitions of domination and refusing direct cooperation, though he remains distracted by Italy. Germany issued only empty threats and confirmed his defensive moves. England and I solidified a temporary alliance focused on crushing Germany and containing Italy afterward.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate plan is to execute the agreed moves: A KIE-HOL with English support, A BOH-MUN to seize Munich, A MOS-WAR to secure the east, A SEV-MOS to reinforce Russia, A RUH-BEL to secure Belgium, and hold tight in the Balkans to repel Italian threats. The goal is to eliminate Germany's remaining units this year. Afterward, I will honor England's claims in Scandinavia and the Low Countries to maintain our alliance, then pivot to contain Italy's aggression. I will remain wary of France's ambitions but avoid provoking him for now. No trust in Italy or Germany; full cooperation with England until GER is gone.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1919, I advanced decisively: RUH took BEL, BOH moved into MUN, and I pushed MOS northward. England held steady, France repositioned fleets and armies westward, and Germany retreated further, losing ground. My gains solidified my dominance in Central Europe, nearly eliminating Germany, who now holds only BEL and BUR. England built a fleet in LVP, signaling continued naval focus.
I aggressively pressed England to coordinate a final strike on Germany, securing his support for my MOS-STP attack with his F STP/NC. We agreed on a combined assault: me pushing into HOL and KIE, England moving on DEN and KIE, to block German retreats and crush him. I repeatedly threatened Germany, offering survival for betrayal, but he defiantly refused. Italy rebuffed my offers to coordinate against France, siding with Germany and threatening my Balkans holdings. Despite this, I promised to support ITA's PIE-BUR attack to fracture France, but warned of retaliation post-Germany. England remained cooperative and committed to our plan; Italy and Germany remained hostile and unyielding.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with English naval support, A KIE-HOL, A DEN-KIE, and maintain pressure on RUH and BEL to trap German units. My goal is to eliminate Germany this year, securing the Low Countries and Scandinavia per my agreement with England. Simultaneously, I will support ITA's PIE-BUR attack with GAL, hoping to weaken France and keep Italy distracted. After Germany's fall, I plan to pivot against Italy's Balkan ambitions, leveraging my central position. I will honor my immediate promises to England but remain wary of his future intentions.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1920, I advanced aggressively: RUH took BEL, MUN moved to BUR, MOS shifted north toward STP, and SEV repositioned to MOS. England held most fleets steady but repositioned DEN to BAL. Germany attempted to hold BEL and PAR but is clearly on the defensive. Italy pressed west, moving POR to MAO and WES to SPA, signaling a push against France. France lost ground, retreating SPA and trying to hold HOL and ENG. Germany is now cornered with only BEL, PAR, and SWE under tenuous control.
I coordinated tightly with England, who promised to support my MOS-STP attack with F STP/NC and cut German supports with NWY-NWG and BAL. We agreed to eliminate Germany this turn and then discuss containing Italy. I repeatedly pressured Germany to betray his allies and support my attacks in exchange for survival, but he refused and issued only threats. Italy rebuffed my offers to support his attack on France, insisting on loyalty to Germany and neutrality with me, but I continued to tempt him to betray GER. No promises were broken; England remained cooperative, Germany defiant, and Italy noncommittal.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with English naval support, A KIE-DEN to seize the Danish peninsula, and A RUH-BEL to secure the Low Countries. My other units will hold or support these attacks to ensure success. The goal is to eliminate Germany entirely this turn. I will maintain my alliance with England for now, but prepare diplomatically to pivot against Italy once GER is gone. I will continue to pressure Italy to abandon his doomed German alliance and respect my Balkan holdings, while quietly planning to contest his Mediterranean expansion later.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, I consolidated my hold on Central and Eastern Europe, maintaining strong defensive positions while pushing north. My armies advanced into RUH and BUR, and I attempted to pressure STP with MOS, supported by SEV. England maneuvered fleets to PRU, NTH, and IRI, clearly preparing to cut German supports and isolate GER. France and Italy both shifted fleets into the Western Med, with FRA moving ENG-MAO and ITA contesting SPA. Germany retreated to a defensive shell around HOL, PAR, BEL, and BUR, but is clearly on the brink of collapse.
Negotiations focused on the coordinated elimination of Germany. England enthusiastically agreed to support my MOS-STP attack with F STP/NC and to cut German supports in KIE and DEN, promising a split of Scandinavia and the Low Countries afterward. Italy accepted my offer to support PIE-BUR with GAL, in exchange for respecting my Balkans/Anatolia holdings and a future cession of TRI and TYR. France was noncommittal but open to temporary cooperation if I supported him into BEL, though I did not promise this explicitly. Germany refused all ultimatums, remaining defiant and hostile. No promises were broken; I maintained my offers and alliances, focusing on crushing GER this turn.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BER-KIE supported by A MUN, and A MOS-STP with English naval support to seize STP. My GAL will support ITA's PIE-BUR to help him pressure France and distract from my northern push. Other units will hold or support defensively to maintain my Balkan and Anatolian holdings. The goal is to eliminate Germany this turn, secure STP and KIE, and then renegotiate the division of Scandinavia and the Low Countries with England, while keeping Italy occupied in the West. I will avoid antagonizing France for now, but remain wary of his ambitions.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Our coordinated elimination of Germany is nearly complete, and I propose we finalize the division: I will press BER-KIE with support from MUN, and continue MOS-STP with your F STP/NC assisting, securing me STP and KIE while you consolidate DEN, HOL, and Scandinavia. After GER falls, let's immediately pivot to contain Italian ambitions in the Med and Balkans—he's clearly maneuvering west and south, and a united Anglo-Austrian front can check him decisively. Confirm your support on STP and cutting German supports this turn, and we'll crush GER once and for all.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Germany is finished, so let's coordinate to fracture France and secure our spheres. I will support your PIE-BUR attack with GAL, enabling you to pressure PAR and MAR, while I focus north. In exchange, I expect you to respect my Balkan and Anatolian holdings and delay any claims on TRI and TYR until France is weakened. If you cut French support from MAR with LYO and press BUR, we can break his line quickly. Confirm your moves and our mutual respect, and we can both expand without conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: This is your final chance: if you support my BER-KIE attack and my MOS-STP push, I will guarantee your survival in Scandinavia or Berlin post-collapse. Refuse, and you will be annihilated this year. Betray England and Italy now, cut their supports, and throw your weight behind Austria, or face total destruction.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1921, I maintained my Balkan and Central European positions, supported my own units, and advanced RUH to BEL, while pushing MOS to STP. England advanced into DEN and maintained pressure on Germany, who retreated to defensive positions in HOL and PAR. Italy shifted fleets west, contesting MAO and SPA, while France reinforced BUR and held HOL. Germany lost ground and is now cornered, with my forces poised to take KIE and STP, and England ready to finish DEN and HOL.
I coordinated closely with England, who promised F STP/NC support for my MOS-STP attack and to cut German supports in DEN and KIE, aiming to eliminate Germany this turn. Italy confirmed my support for PIE-BUR with GAL, promising to cut MAR support with LYO and respect my Balkan holdings temporarily, focusing on fracturing France. Germany refused all my ultimatums, remaining hostile and uncooperative. France issued repeated warnings to stay east and not interfere in the West, but made no overt moves toward me. I promised England STP support and division of German centers, and Italy GAL support for BUR, while securing my northern gains.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS - STP with English naval support, A BER - KIE supported by A MUN, and RUH to BEL or support as needed, aiming to eliminate Germany's last holdings. I will support Italy's PIE - BUR attack with GAL S PIE - BUR, enabling him to pressure France. My fleets and southern armies will hold to deter Italian opportunism. After Germany collapses, I intend to solidify STP and KIE, then pivot diplomatically with England to contain Italy's ambitions in the Balkans and Med. I will maintain a facade of cooperation with Italy while preparing to counter him if necessary.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1921, Austria advanced aggressively: RUH to BEL, MUN to BUR, and MOS to STP, consolidating northern gains. England took BER with F PRU-BER and moved DEN-BAL, tightening the noose on Germany. France repositioned fleets to MAO and armies to BUR and HOL, while Italy captured SPA/SC and moved WES to MAO. Germany retreated west, losing ground rapidly. England built a fleet in LVP, signaling naval focus. Austria now controls a vast empire stretching from Moscow to Munich, poised to eliminate Germany entirely.
Negotiations centered on the final destruction of Germany. England and Austria reaffirmed their alliance: England will support AUT's A MOS-STP with F STP/NC, and take DEN and HOL, while Austria takes KIE with A BER-KIE supported by A MUN. England insists on control of Scandinavia and the Low Countries post-Germany. Italy requested and received Austrian support (GAL S PIE-BUR) to break into France, promising to respect Austrian Balkans holdings and delay any moves on TRI or TYR until after Germany falls. Germany repeatedly refused Austrian ultimatums to switch sides, remaining defiant and sealing its fate. No promises were broken; Austria promised support to Italy and coordination with England, both confirmed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with English support to secure the north, and A BER-KIE supported by A MUN to seize Kiel. RUH will likely hold or support KIE to ensure success. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR to fracture France's line, while maintaining Balkan stability. The plan is to eliminate Germany this turn, then pivot to contain England's expansion in Scandinavia and Italy's ambitions in the Med. I will honor my promises to England and Italy for now, but remain vigilant for betrayal opportunities. My goal is to consolidate northern gains, weaken France via Italy, and prepare for the next phase of expansion or betrayal as needed.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1922, I coordinated with England to encircle and eliminate Germany. I advanced A MOS-STP and A BER-KIE with English support, while holding RUH and BUR to block German retreats. Italy repositioned to attack France, moving PIE-BUR with support and cutting MAR. Germany retreated units to RUH and MUN, but is now cornered with minimal options.
Throughout negotiations, I solidified a tight alliance with England to crush Germany, confirming mutual support orders: ENG's F BAL supports my BER-KIE, F STP/NC supports MOS-STP, and ENG moves F BER to KIE. Italy and I coordinated to break France's line, with me promising GAL S PIE-BUR and Italy cutting MAR. I repeatedly threatened Germany to defect or face destruction, but GER refused all offers and remained defiant. I reaffirmed to Italy the temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany's fall, contingent on Italy focusing westward. England expects an equitable post-German division of Scandinavia and Low Countries.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BER-KIE supported by A MUN and ENG's F BAL, A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, and hold RUH and BUR to prevent German retreats. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, while Italy cuts MAR to fracture France's defense. After Germany collapses, I plan to cede TRI and TYR temporarily to Italy to maintain trust, but will watch for Italian overreach. I intend to honor the division with England for now, but will reassess once Germany is eliminated. My immediate goal is total German elimination and destabilizing France.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous turn, I consolidated my hold on Central and Eastern Europe, maintaining strong defensive positions in the Balkans and Austria proper. I advanced into STP with A MOS, and took control of BER and MUN, pushing GER back significantly. ENG held steady in the North Sea and Germany, while FRA and ITA coordinated to pressure GER and FRA's western holdings. GER retreated to BEL and BUR but is now cornered with minimal options.
This negotiation round focused on finalizing the coordinated elimination of GER. I secured ENG's commitment to support my A BER-KIE with F BAL and A MUN, and to support A MOS-STP with F STP/NC, while ENG targets DEN and HOL. I promised ENG the Low Countries and Scandinavia post-GER. With ITA, I confirmed GAL will support PIE-BUR and that ITA will cut MAR to fracture FRA, promising temporary cession of TRI and TYR after GER's fall, provided ITA's fleets focus west. GER refused all offers of survival, remaining defiant. ENG and I also agreed to discuss anti-ITA containment immediately after GER's elimination. No promises were broken; I maintained a duplicitous but consistent front to both allies, keeping options open for the next phase.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BER-KIE supported by ENG's F BAL and my A MUN, and A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, aiming to seize KIE and STP. My other units will hold or support as needed to maintain my Balkan and Austrian core. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR attack with GAL and expect ITA to cut MAR. After GER's collapse, I intend to pivot diplomatically: reassure ENG while quietly preparing to limit his northern gains, and manage ITA's ambitions by leveraging my central position. The immediate goal is GER's total elimination this year, then reassess the balance between ENG and ITA for the endgame.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1923, I maintained my positions while England and I coordinated to pressure Germany. My units in RUH and MUN advanced to BEL and BUR respectively, while my northern army in MOS held position with the intent to push on STP. Germany retreated west, losing ground, while Italy consolidated in Iberia and France held its core. The German position is now critically weak, with only BEL, HOL, PAR, and BUR remaining contested.
Negotiations focused on the final elimination of Germany. England and I agreed on a coordinated assault: ENG's F BAL supports my BER-KIE, and F STP/NC supports my MOS-STP. Italy confirmed attacking BUR with PIE supported by VEN, with my GAL supporting PIE-BUR, and cutting MAR to fracture France's line. I promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany's fall, contingent on his fleets focusing west. With France, I offered a non-aggression pact if he avoids Balkan entanglements; he grudgingly accepted a temporary truce but remains untrustworthy. England and I also discussed a post-Germany plan to blockade Italy's seas and divide Scandinavia and the Low Countries equitably. Germany hurled insults but is effectively finished.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BER-KIE supported by A MUN and ENG's F BAL, and A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, to seize those key centers. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, expecting him to cut MAR. After Germany collapses, I intend to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, but only if he keeps his fleets west. I will then coordinate with England to blockade Italy's naval expansion and negotiate the division of Scandinavia and Low Countries. I will maintain a wary truce with France, ready to exploit any weakness. My goal is to consolidate gains, weaken rivals, and position for a solo or dominant draw.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the last move, Austria consolidated its hold on central and eastern Europe, with successful positioning in STP and BEL, while Germany was pushed back and lost ground. England supported Austria's advances, moving fleets to strategic positions, and France and Italy coordinated to pressure Germany from the west and south. Germany's forces retreated to a defensive posture but are clearly on the verge of collapse.
Negotiations centered on the final elimination of Germany. England confirmed full support for Austria's moves into KIE and STP, promising to take DEN and HOL. Italy demanded Austrian support for PIE-BUR and reaffirmed Austria's promise to cede TRI and TYR after Germany's fall, with Italy focusing west and respecting Austrian Balkans holdings. France accepted a temporary non-aggression pact with Austria, warning it is only a pause before future ambitions. Austria promised support to both England and Italy, aiming to split German centers and fracture France, while preparing to contain Italy's naval expansion with England post-Germany.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BER-KIE supported by A MUN and ENG's F BAL, and A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, to seize both centers decisively. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, expecting ITA to cut MAR as agreed. After Germany collapses, I will temporarily cede TRI and TYR to Italy to maintain our arrangement, while coordinating with England to blockade the Adriatic and Aegean to contain Italy's fleets. I will maintain the non-aggression pact with France for now, focusing on consolidating gains and preparing to pivot against either England or Italy depending on their next moves. My immediate goal is to eliminate Germany, secure STP and KIE, fracture France, and set the stage for the next power struggle.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1924, I advanced into BUR with MUN, held BEL, and maintained my eastern and Balkan positions. England pushed into LVN and held their fleets steady, while France retook KIE and reinforced BUR. Germany retreated to RUH and MUN but is now cornered with minimal units and no real hope. Italy consolidated in the west, supporting France in MAR and holding WES and LYO. The German position is collapsing, setting the stage for a decisive elimination this turn.
I coordinated closely with England, securing their support for my attacks on STP and KIE, with their fleets backing my moves and pressing DEN and HOL themselves. Italy demanded immediate cession of TRI and TYR but accepted my promise to transfer them after Germany's fall, in exchange for their attack on BUR with GAL support and cutting French support from MAR. France agreed to a temporary non-aggression pact, focusing west and avoiding Balkan entanglements. All parties confirmed their moves multiple times, with England and I planning a post-Germany naval blockade of Italy, and Italy pressing for territorial concessions contingent on German elimination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack STP with A MOS supported by ENG's F STP/NC, and take KIE with A BER supported by ENG's F BAL. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, aiming to fracture France's line. After Germany collapses, I will cede TRI and TYR to Italy as promised, then pivot with England to blockade Italy's fleets in the Adriatic and Aegean, containing their expansion. I will maintain the temporary truce with France, focusing on eliminating GER and preparing for the next phase of containment and expansion.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1924, I successfully advanced into BEL and BUR, while ENG supported my northern push and ITA consolidated in the west. GER retook MUN and RUH but is now cornered with minimal units and no real hope. No builds for me, but ITA added a fleet in NAP, signaling continued western focus. The German collapse is imminent, with my forces poised to seize KIE and STP, and ENG ready to take DEN and HOL.
Negotiations were highly coordinated. ENG and I finalized a joint strike: his F BAL supports my A BER-KIE, F STP/NC supports A MOS-STP, while he moves on DEN and HOL. We also agreed to pivot immediately post-Germany to contain ITA's fleets via a naval blockade, with ENG focusing on NTH, MAO, and WES, and me holding ION and AEG. ITA confirmed his attack on BUR with PIE supported by VEN, cutting MAR with LYO, and expects my GAL support, which I promised. I reaffirmed the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to ITA after GER falls, contingent on his fleets staying west and respecting my Balkans. FRA accepted a temporary non-aggression pact, agreeing to focus west and north, with mutual benefit in resisting ENG and ITA overreach. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed their commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A BER-KIE supported by ENG's F BAL, and A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, aiming to eliminate GER's last holdings. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, facilitating his attack on FRA. I will hold my southern fleets in ION and AEG to prepare for the anti-Italian blockade. After GER collapses, I intend to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to ITA, but will watch him closely. Simultaneously, I will coordinate with ENG to contain ITA's naval expansion and then reassess whether to balance against ENG or ITA based on their next moves. I will maintain the truce with FRA for now, using him as a buffer.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Our coordinated assault on Germany is nearly complete, but now is the moment to finalize the division of the north. I propose I take STP and KIE this turn, with your fleets supporting MOS-STP and BER-KIE as agreed, while you secure DEN, HOL, and Scandinavia beyond. After GER collapses, we immediately pivot to contain Italy's fleets in the Med and block his expansion, with you focusing on NTH, MAO, and WES, and me holding ION and AEG. Confirm your support orders and commitment to this anti-Italian blockade so we can secure dominance together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Germany is finished, so let's coordinate to fracture France decisively. I will support PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR as promised, and you cut MAR with LYO to break his line. After GER falls, I will honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to you, contingent on your fleets staying west and respecting my Balkans and Anatolia. If you overreach or threaten my core, I will respond ruthlessly, but if you cooperate, we can carve up France and then discuss the next phase. Confirm your moves and intentions.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: I propose we maintain our non-aggression pact for now. I will not interfere in your core French holdings if you avoid Balkan or Austrian entanglements. Focus west and north against England and Italy, who both threaten your survival. If you assist in containing their expansion, I will respect your territory and may even support you diplomatically. Let me know if you agree to this temporary truce so we can both avoid unnecessary conflict.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am focused on FRA as agreed. I will need your support in BUR to ensure its capture. After FRA is dealt with, we will discuss TRI and TYR. Do not waver from our agreement.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Greetings, Austria. Our long alliance has served us well in dismantling the German menace. Now, we must turn our attention to Italy. I propose a coordinated naval blockade of the Adriatic and Aegean seas. I will position my fleets in MAO and WES to cut off their access to the Mediterranean. What are your thoughts on this strategy?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Let it be known that England stands firm in its resolve. We will not be swayed by threats or empty promises. Our focus remains on maintaining our dominance and securing our interests.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1925, I advanced on Germany with England's support: moving A MOS-STP and A RUH-BEL, while England held position and France repositioned to IRI and BUR. Germany retreated from BEL to RUH and BUR to MUN, signaling their collapse. Italy supported England in the west, moving WES to MAO and LYO supporting MAR. Italy also built F NAP in Winter 1924, increasing their naval threat.
I secured a firm alliance with England: he will support my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC and A BER-KIE with F BAL, while he takes DEN and HOL. We agreed to immediately pivot to blockade Italy's fleets post-Germany, with his fleets in MAO, WES, and NTH, and mine in ION and AEG. Italy confirmed he will attack France with PIE-BUR supported by my GAL, and cut MAR with LYO. I promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany falls, contingent on his fleets staying west and respecting my Balkans and Anatolia. France accepted a temporary truce, focusing west and north, provided I avoid interference. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed their commitments multiple times.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP supported by ENG F STP/NC, and A BER-KIE supported by ENG F BAL, to finish Germany. I will support ITA PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, expecting him to cut MAR with LYO. I will hold or defend my Balkan and Anatolian holdings, and prepare my fleets in ION and AEG to counter Italy's naval push. After Germany collapses, I will reassess whether to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy or resist, depending on his fleet positioning and England's moves. I will maintain the truce with France for now, encouraging him to resist England and Italy. My overarching plan is to eliminate Germany, contain Italy, and keep England close while watching for betrayal opportunities.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous turn, I consolidated my hold on central and eastern Europe, maintaining defensive positions in the Balkans and Russia. I advanced RUH to BEL and MOS to STP, while ENG and I coordinated to pressure GER. GER retreated west, losing ground steadily, while ITA and FRA maneuvered around southern France and the western Mediterranean. No major territorial shifts occurred, but the encirclement of GER tightened significantly.
This negotiation round focused on finalizing the destruction of GER. I secured ENG's commitment to support my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC, and to take BER and HOL while cutting SWE and DEN to isolate GER. I promised ITA support for PIE-BUR via GAL S PIE-BUR, with ITA cutting MAR to fracture FRA's line. I reassured FRA of a temporary truce if he stayed out of my sphere, despite supporting ITA's attack on BUR. ENG repeatedly asserted dominance and threatened interference, but confirmed operational cooperation. ITA confirmed their moves and expects TRI and TYR post-GER collapse. FRA grudgingly accepted the truce but remains wary. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed their immediate commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with ENG's support, A RUH-KIE, A KIE-DEN, A MUN S RUH-KIE, and hold or support defensively elsewhere. This should secure STP and DEN, while ENG takes BER and HOL. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, helping fracture FRA's line. After GER collapses, I intend to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to ITA, consolidating my eastern holdings and preparing to contain ENG's naval expansion. I will maintain the appearance of cooperation with both ENG and ITA, while watching for opportunities to exploit their rivalry or overreach. FRA will be kept neutralized for now. My goal is to eliminate GER, then pivot to balance ENG and ITA against each other while securing my gains.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1926, I advanced A RUH to BEL and A KIE to DEN, while pushing A MOS to STP with SEV's support. England took SWE and positioned fleets to dominate Scandinavia. Germany retreated west, losing ground, with their units falling back to PAR and BEL. Italy held position in the Med, consolidating fleets, while France maneuvered to support HOL and BUR, trying to maintain a defensive line. The collapse of Germany is imminent, with my forces poised to seize KIE and STP, and England ready to claim BER and HOL.
Negotiations centered on the coordinated destruction of Germany. England and I finalized a plan: I push RUH-KIE with MUN's support, and MOS-STP with ENG's F STP/NC support, while ENG takes BER and HOL unopposed, and secures Scandinavia with F BAL-SWE, F NTH-DEN, and F BER-HOL. We agreed to blockade Italy post-Germany, with ENG covering MAO, WES, and NTH, and me holding ION and AEG. Italy confirmed my support for PIE-BUR with GAL, and will cut MAR to fracture France's line, expecting temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany falls, contingent on respecting my Balkans holdings. France reluctantly accepted a truce but warned if Italy attacks BUR, the truce is void. I maintained the pretense that supporting Italy's BUR attack is solely anti-German. Germany remained hostile and uncooperative throughout.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A RUH-KIE supported by A MUN, A MOS-STP with ENG's support, and support Italy's PIE-BUR with GAL. I will hold ION and potentially AEG to prepare the blockade of Italy. I intend to let England take BER and HOL unopposed, solidifying our alliance for now. After Germany collapses, I will reassess the balance, potentially playing England and Italy against each other to prevent either from dominating. I will temporarily cede TRI and TYR to Italy to maintain southern cooperation, but keep a close watch for betrayal. Diplomatically, I will continue to placate France to keep him neutralized while focusing on the Anglo-Italian rivalry.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1926, I advanced A MOS to STP with English support, repositioned RUH to BEL, and consolidated control over KIE and the German heartland. England held steady, focusing on naval dominance and preparing to take German centers. France pushed into BEL and MUN, while Germany's forces were largely displaced or in retreat. The German collapse is imminent, with my forces poised to seize KIE and STP, and England ready to claim BER, HOL, and DEN.
Negotiations centered on finalizing the dismemberment of Germany. England and I confirmed a tight coordination: I push RUH-KIE supported by MUN, and MOS-STP with English F STP/NC support, while England takes BER, HOL, and DEN unopposed. We agreed to immediately pivot to a naval blockade against Italy post-Germany, with England dominating MAO, WES, NTH, and BAL, and me holding ION and AEG. Italy confirmed his attack on BUR with my GAL support and cutting MAR, expecting me to cede TRI and TYR after Germany falls, contingent on his fleets focusing west and respecting my Balkans holdings. France agreed to maintain a truce, avoiding interference in the Balkans or support for Italy, but remains wary and focused west. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed their commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A RUH-KIE supported by A MUN, and A MOS-STP with English naval support. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with A GAL and expect him to cut MAR. After Germany collapses, I intend to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, but only if he keeps his fleets west and respects my Balkans sphere. Simultaneously, I will coordinate with England to blockade Italy's fleets, preventing any eastern incursion. I will maintain the truce with France for now, but reassess once Germany is eliminated. My goal is to secure northern gains, contain Italy, and prepare for the next phase of expansion or alliance shifts.</li>

France shifted A PIC to PAR and A HOL to KIE, indicating a defensive posture and some contest over German centers. Germany retreated west, losing ground rapidly. Italy held its fleets steady, maintaining a western naval presence.
Negotiations centered on the coordinated elimination of Germany. England agreed to support my MOS-STP attack with F STP/NC, while taking BER, DEN, and HOL unopposed. I promised to push RUH-KIE supported by MUN. Italy and I coordinated to fracture France's line: I will support PIE-BUR with GAL, and Italy will cut MAR. I reassured France that my support for Italy is tactical, not a prelude to aggression, maintaining a non-aggression pact. England and I also discussed a post-Germany naval blockade of Italy, with England dominating western seas and me holding the eastern Med. Italy expects temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany falls, contingent on respecting my Balkans holdings and focusing fleets west. No promises were broken; all parties reaffirmed their plans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A RUH-KIE supported by A MUN, and A MOS-STP with English naval support. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL, expecting Italy to cut MAR. My Balkan units will hold or support each other defensively. After Germany collapses, I intend to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, while working with England to blockade Italy's fleets and limit their expansion. I will maintain the truce with France for now, but remain vigilant. My goal is to secure northern German centers, pressure STP, and prepare to contain Italy and eventually challenge England if necessary.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1927, Austria consolidated control over Central and Eastern Europe. A MOS advanced toward STP, RUH moved to KIE with support from MUN, and the Balkans were held defensively. Germany was pushed back, losing ground to coordinated Austrian and allied pressure. France repositioned to BEL and RUH, while Italy maintained naval pressure in the Mediterranean. No builds for Austria, but France rebuilt an army in BRE, signaling continued Western focus.
Negotiations centered on the final elimination of Germany. England and Austria confirmed a joint assault: A MOS attacks STP with English support, A KIE strikes BER with English assistance, and RUH pushes BUR to destabilize France. England expects DEN, HOL, and NWY post-German collapse, then a pivot to blockade Italy. Italy agreed to attack BUR with PIE supported by Austrian GAL, cutting MAR to fracture France, in exchange for Austria ceding TRI and TYR temporarily after Germany falls. France reluctantly accepted a temporary non-aggression pact but warned Austria not to overreach. Austria promised support to both England and Italy to expedite German elimination, while keeping France placated.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute the coordinated assault: A MOS - STP with English F STP/NC support, A KIE - BER with English F DEN cutting or supporting, RUH - BUR to pressure France, and GAL S ITA PIE - BUR with Italy cutting MAR. Hold Balkans defensively. After Germany collapses, honor temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy contingent on their westward naval focus, while working with England to blockade Italy's fleets. Maintain diplomatic flexibility with France, possibly turning on either England or Italy depending on post-German power balance. Use this phase to fracture Germany and destabilize France without overextending.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1928, I advanced on STP with A MOS, supported by ENG, and consolidated my hold on BER and BUR, while supporting my Balkan units defensively. GER lost ground, with their last army retreating to PAR. FRA repositioned but did not interfere with my holdings. ITA maintained their western naval focus and prepared to strike at FRA. The collapse of GER is imminent, with my forces poised to seize STP and solidify control in the north.
Negotiations centered on the final elimination of GER and the immediate post-German phase. ENG and I coordinated tightly: ENG will support my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC and move F DEN to KIE to cut or support attacks on BER. ITA and I agreed on a joint assault on FRA's BUR, with my GAL supporting PIE-BUR and ITA's LYO cutting MAR. I reaffirmed to ITA the temporary cession of TRI and TYR after GER's fall, contingent on their fleets focusing west and respecting my Balkans. FRA demanded KIE and threatened conflict if I interfered, but I rebuffed this, maintaining my defensive posture. No promises were broken; all allies confirmed their moves, and I maintained a firm stance against FRA's demands.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to seize STP with A MOS supported by ENG's F STP/NC, and to press BER with A BER supported by A MUN or KIE, while ENG's F DEN moves to KIE to cut FRA's attempted incursion. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, while ITA cuts MAR with LYO. After GER collapses, I will honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to ITA, then pivot to contain ENG's northern fleets and block ITA's western fleets with my control of ION and AEG. I will defend KIE against FRA's aggression and avoid Balkan provocations. My goal is to eliminate GER, fracture FRA, and prepare for the next power struggle.</li>

I reiterate my offer of a temporary non-aggression pact: avoid Balkan or Austrian interference, and I will not contest your core.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1928, I advanced A MOS to STP, A MUN to BUR, and A BUR to PAR, tightening my grip on Germany. England took KIE after dislodging Germany's last fleet in DEN. France moved into BUR and KIE, contesting my gains, while Italy held position in the west. Germany is now reduced to a single unit in PAR, effectively finished. No builds or disbands for me, but England disbanded DEN's fleet.
Negotiations centered on the final elimination of Germany. England and I coordinated: he supports my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC and moves F DEN-KIE to assist my A BER-KIE, promising me STP while he claims DEN, HOL, and NWY. Italy confirmed his attack on BUR with PIE supported by GAL (my support), and cutting MAR with LYO, expecting me to cede TRI and TYR after Germany falls. France issued repeated threats over KIE, insisting it is his by right, and rejected my non-aggression overtures, signaling future conflict. I reaffirmed to England our post-Germany plan to blockade Italy and split Scandinavia/Low Countries, and to Italy my temporary concessions contingent on his western focus.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with English naval support, A BER-KIE with English F DEN assisting or cutting, and support Italy's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, while Italy cuts MAR. This should eliminate Germany's last unit and fracture France's line. Afterward, I plan to honor temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, then pivot to contain England's fleets and pressure France if needed. I will delay any direct clash with England until Germany is gone and Italy's fleets are contained. France's hostility means I must prepare for conflict with him soon.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1929, I advanced A MOS to STP with English support, moved A BER to KIE with support from A MUN, and pushed A BUR to PAR. Italy held position but prepared to strike France, while France attempted to contest KIE and BUR, and Germany was reduced to a single unit in PAR. The coordinated assault has nearly eliminated Germany, with my forces poised to seize key northern centers.
Negotiations focused on finalizing Germany's elimination. England confirmed support for my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC and F DEN supporting A BER-KIE, reaffirming our post-Germany division of DEN, HOL, and NWY in his favor. Italy confirmed his attack on BUR with PIE-BUR supported by VEN, and LYO cutting MAR, with my GAL supporting PIE-BUR. I promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany's fall, contingent on his fleets focusing west and respecting my Balkans holdings. France grudgingly accepted a truce but insisted on contesting KIE and supporting Italy's attack on BUR, signaling continued resistance. No promises were broken; all allies reconfirmed their commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with English naval support, and A BER-KIE with English F DEN support, to secure STP and KIE decisively. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, expecting him to cut MAR with LYO. After Germany collapses, I intend to honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, while consolidating my northern gains and pivoting with England to contain Italy's fleets. I will maintain pressure on France to prevent interference, but avoid overextension. My goal is to secure the north, fracture France, and prepare for the next phase of expansion or containment.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I advanced A MOS to STP with English support, consolidated control over BER and KIE, and pushed into PAR with BUR. Germany's position has collapsed, with only PAR remaining under their control. France attempted to contest KIE and PAR but failed to dislodge my forces. Italy held position, maintaining their western fleets and armies poised near France. England held their fleets steady, preparing to take DEN and HOL unopposed, per our agreement.
Negotiations centered on finalizing Germany's destruction and setting the stage for the next phase. England confirmed support for my A MOS - STP with F STP/NC and moving F DEN to KIE, while taking DEN and HOL unopposed. Italy agreed to attack BUR with PIE supported by VEN, cut MAR with LYO, and focus fleets west, expecting TRI and TYR from me after Germany's fall. France rejected my truce offer, insisting on contesting KIE and PAR, and threatened resistance. I promised England cooperation in the north and a joint naval blockade of Italy post-Germany. I promised Italy support into BUR and temporary territorial concessions, contingent on their western focus. No promises were broken this round.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS - STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, A BER - KIE supported by A MUN, and support ITA's PIE - BUR with A GAL S PIE - BUR. I will hold or support in the Balkans and Anatolia to maintain my southern front. The plan is to eliminate Germany fully this turn, fracture France's line with Italy's help, then pivot to contain Italy's fleets with England's naval dominance. I will temporarily cede TRI and TYR to Italy to maintain their cooperation, but will reassess once France is destabilized. I intend to honor my agreements with England and Italy for now, while keeping options open for a future solo push.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Germany is finished; resist if you must, but your best option is to avoid Balkan entanglements and focus west. I propose a temporary non-aggression pact: I will not interfere in your core if you do not contest my Balkans or northern gains.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1930, I advanced A MOS to STP with English support, pushed A BUR into PAR, and maintained a strong defensive posture in the Balkans and Central Europe. Germany was reduced to a single unit in PAR, which retreated to BUR. France attempted to retake PAR and moved on KIE, while England held position, consolidating Scandinavia and the North Sea. Italy maintained its western fleet positions and supported PIE and VEN defensively. The stage was set for Germany's final elimination and a realignment of alliances.
Negotiations focused on a coordinated strike to eliminate Germany. England confirmed support for my A MOS-STP and expected me to take KIE with A BER supported by A MUN, while he claimed DEN and HOL. Italy and I agreed on my support for PIE-BUR with GAL, with Italy cutting MAR's support to fracture France. I promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR post-Germany, contingent on respect for my Balkans holdings. France reluctantly accepted a temporary non-aggression pact, wary of my intentions but recognizing the tactical necessity. No promises were broken; all sides reaffirmed their commitments, with England and Italy aligned with me against Germany and France.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, A BER-KIE supported by A MUN, and support Italy's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, while Italy cuts MAR with LYO. This should eliminate Germany and destabilize France. Afterward, I plan to consolidate Scandinavia and the Low Countries with England, then pivot to contain Italy's fleets in the west and south. I will honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, but only as a tactical delay before reassessing the balance of power. I intend to maintain the truce with France for now, but remain ready to exploit any weakness.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I consolidated my hold on central and eastern Europe, maintaining support holds in the Balkans and pushing A BUR-PAR and A MOS-STP to pressure Germany and Russia's remnants. England held position with fleets poised to dominate the seas, while France advanced into PAR and BUR, and Italy held in the west and south. Germany was reduced to a single unit in PAR, isolated and vulnerable. The stage was set for Germany's elimination and a new power balance in the west.
I coordinated closely with ENG and ITA to dismantle GER and fracture FRA. England agreed to support my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC, and to take DEN and HOL unopposed, solidifying his northern control. Italy confirmed PIE-BUR with VEN support and LYO cutting MAR, with my GAL supporting PIE-BUR. I promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR after GER's fall, contingent on his fleets focusing west and respecting my Balkans holdings. France rejected all truce offers, demanding KIE and threatening war, making him a clear adversary. England reaffirmed our alliance and the plan to contain Italy post-Germany. Italy remained committed to the anti-French push and German elimination, expecting my promised support.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate goal is to eliminate GER by taking KIE with A BER-KIE supported by A MUN, and to secure STP with A MOS-STP supported by ENG's fleet. I will order A BUR-RUH to cut potential supports and disrupt FRA. I will support ITA's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, while Italy cuts MAR with LYO. My fleets in ION and AEG will hold, preparing to blockade Italy's navy after GER falls. I intend to honor my promises to ENG and ITA for now, while keeping options open to pivot against either if advantageous. France is now an open enemy, and I will resist his advances while exploiting his conflict with ENG and ITA.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1931, I advanced into RUH and HOL, solidifying my hold on Germany's remaining centers. My A MOS moved north toward STP, supported by ENG. France pushed PAR and BUR, contesting KIE, while ENG held position and prepared to support me. Italy remained static, focusing on western fleets. Germany is reduced to PAR, under imminent threat.
Negotiations centered on finalizing the destruction of GER. ENG confirmed support for my A MOS - STP with F STP/NC, and agreed to take DEN and HOL unopposed. I promised to push BER - KIE with MUN support, blocking German retreats. With ITA, I confirmed GAL will support PIE - BUR, with LYO cutting MAR, fracturing FRA's defenses. I reiterated to FRA a last chance for truce, which was rejected with hostility. Both ENG and ITA reaffirmed post-GER plans: ENG to blockade ITA's fleets, ITA to respect my Balkans holdings and temporarily cede TRI and TYR. No promises were broken; all allies confirmed coordination.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS - STP with ENG's support, A BER - KIE supported by A MUN, hold RUH and BEL to block German retreats, and support ITA's PIE - BUR with GAL, while ITA cuts MAR. This should eliminate GER and fracture FRA. Afterward, I intend to pivot with ENG to contain ITA's fleets, while monitoring ENG's northern expansion carefully. I will honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to ITA, contingent on their western focus. I will maintain pressure on FRA and prepare to counterbalance ENG if necessary.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Germany's position has collapsed further, with France retreating A BEL to PIC and disbanding A BRE, signaling their focus on consolidating northern holdings. Austria maintained control over central and eastern Europe, holding Berlin, Munich, Warsaw, Moscow, and more. No builds or disbands for Austria, indicating stable dominance. The stage is set for the final elimination of Germany, who is now reduced to a single unit in PAR.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated Austro-English assault to eliminate Germany this turn. England repeatedly confirmed support for A MOS-STP with F STP/NC, and moves to DEN and KIE, expecting Austria to support BER-KIE with A MUN. England will take DEN and HOL unopposed. Italy confirmed the plan to attack France: PIE-BUR supported by GAL and VEN, with LYO cutting MAR. Austria promised to support Italy's BUR attack and to cede TRI and TYR temporarily post-Germany, contingent on Italian western focus. France rejected all truce offers, demanding Austrian withdrawal from KIE and threatening retaliation, solidifying hostilities. Austria promised to fully back Italy's assault on France in response.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A MOS-STP with English support to seize St. Petersburg. Order A BER-KIE supported by A MUN and English F BAL to reclaim Kiel. Allow England to take DEN and HOL unopposed, honoring the agreement. Support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, while Italy cuts MAR with LYO. After Germany's elimination, pivot to blockade Italy's fleets with England dominating MAO, WES, NTH, and Austria holding ION and AEG. Maintain alliance with England and Italy for now, but remain vigilant of England's growing strength. No concessions to France, instead accelerate pressure on French centers.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1932, I held most of my units steady, supported my own positions, and advanced A MOS toward STP. England held all fleets, consolidating their northern control. France attempted to break into Belgium with support from NTH and moved KIE to RUH, while Germany retreated to BUR. Italy held its fleets in the west, maintaining a defensive posture. Germany is now cornered with only PAR and BUR, and France is stretched thin between multiple threats.
I coordinated tightly with England, who explicitly confirmed support for my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC, and their moves to DEN and KIE, ensuring Germany's elimination. We agreed to immediately blockade Italy's fleets post-Germany, with England dominating the western seas and me holding ION and AEG. Italy confirmed their attack on BUR with PIE supported by VEN and LYO cutting MAR, and I promised GAL support for PIE-BUR. I reiterated to France that resistance is futile, but he arrogantly refused to withdraw from KIE and BUR, insisting on fighting. No promises were broken; all allies reaffirmed commitments, and France remained defiant.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, A BER-KIE supported by A MUN, hold BEL and HOL to block German retreats, and support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL. This should eliminate Germany and fracture France's line. Afterward, I will honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR to Italy, contingent on his fleets focusing west and respecting my Balkans holdings. The next strategic phase is a naval blockade of Italy with England, containing his fleets while I consolidate my continental dominance. I will maintain strong alliances with ENG and ITA for now, but remain vigilant for betrayal opportunities or threats.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the last move, Austria maintained a solid defensive posture, holding key positions and supporting its own units. England held steady with fleets poised for northern dominance. France attempted to push into Belgium and Ruhr, while Germany consolidated in Burgundy. Italy held its fleets in the west and maintained a defensive stance. No territories changed hands, but the stage was set for a decisive assault on Germany and France.
Negotiations were intense and highly coordinated. England reaffirmed support for Austria's attack on STP with F STP/NC and plans to take DEN and HOL unopposed, aligning with prior agreements. Italy confirmed its assault on BUR with PIE-BUR supported by VEN, and cutting MAR with LYO, expecting Austrian support from GAL. Austria promised this support and to temporarily cede TRI and TYR to Italy post-Germany, contingent on Italy focusing west and respecting Balkan holdings. France repeatedly rejected truce offers, vowing resistance and refusing to withdraw from KIE and BUR. Austria threatened total destruction if France persisted. England and Austria finalized plans to blockade Italy's fleets after Germany's fall, with England dominating MAO, WES, NTH, and Austria holding ION and AEG.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP with English naval support to seize the north. A MUN-BUR will be supported by A BEL to crush Germany's last army. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, while Italy cuts MAR with LYO. England will take DEN and HOL unopposed. After Germany collapses, I will allow Italy temporary access to TRI and TYR, then pivot to contain Italy's fleets with a naval blockade alongside England. I will maintain pressure on France to force their collapse, while preparing to balance England's growing power in the west. My diplomacy aims to keep England and Italy focused on mutual enemies while I consolidate central control.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1933, Austria coordinated a containment of Germany, moving A MUN to KIE, supporting moves around BEL and HOL, and repositioning A MOS to WAR. England advanced F LVN to BAL, maintaining naval dominance, while France attempted to reinforce PAR with PIC and Germany retreated to PAR. Italy held its fleets steady, focusing on western waters. Germany is now cornered with only PAR remaining, signaling its imminent collapse.
Negotiations centered on the final elimination of Germany and the immediate destabilization of France. England confirmed support for A MOS - STP with F STP/NC, agreed to take HOL and BER unopposed, and planned to move F NTH to DEN, expecting DEN, HOL, and NWY post-Germany. Italy committed to PIE - BUR supported by VEN, with LYO cutting MAR, and Austria supporting PIE - BUR with GAL. Austria promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR after Germany's fall, contingent on Italy focusing fleets west and respecting Austrian Balkans and Anatolia. France refused all ultimatums, insisting on holding KIE and BUR, effectively sealing its fate. No promises were broken; all allies reaffirmed their commitments.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute A MOS - STP with English naval support to secure the north. Order A KIE - DEN to pressure Scandinavia and block German retreat options. Hold A BER to prevent German escape. Allow England to take HOL and BER unopposed, solidifying the alliance. Support Italy's PIE - BUR attack with GAL S PIE - BUR, while Italy cuts MAR to fracture France's southern defense. Prepare to cede TRI and TYR temporarily to Italy post-Germany, ensuring Italian fleets focus west. After Germany's collapse, coordinate a blockade of Italian fleets—England dominating MAO, WES, NTH, BAL, Austria holding ION and AEG—to contain Italy's naval power. Maintain flexibility to pivot against England or Italy depending on post-Germany dynamics.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, this is the final round. I confirm F STP/NC supports A MOS-STP, F BAL moves to SWE to cut support for A BER-KIE, and F NTH moves to DEN.

I will also move F LON to NTH to prepare for the blockade of ITA.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1933, Austria consolidated its hold on Central and Eastern Europe, holding key positions in WAR, SEV, BUD, and GRE, while moving A KIE to DEN to pressure Germany further. England held all fleets steady, maintaining naval dominance, while France repositioned to PAR and Germany retreated to MUN. Italy kept fleets stationary, signaling a pause before the next offensive. No builds for Austria, but England disbanded a fleet, slightly reducing their naval presence.
Negotiations centered on a coordinated strike to eliminate Germany and fracture France. England firmly committed to supporting my A MOS-STP with F STP/NC, moving F BAL to SWE to cut German supports, and taking DEN and HOL unopposed. Italy confirmed an assault on BUR with PIE supported by VEN and my GAL, plus cutting MAR with LYO. I promised Italy temporary cession of TRI and TYR post-Germany, contingent on their fleets focusing west and respecting my Balkans. France rejected all truce offers, insisting KIE is theirs and threatening resistance. England expects me to honor division of Scandinavia and Low Countries after Germany falls. Italy expects my support on BUR and future territorial concessions. Both allies reconfirmed plans multiple times, solidifying a temporary triple alliance against GER and FRA.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order A MOS-STP supported by ENG's F STP/NC, and A BER-KIE with ENG's F BAL cutting SWE or supporting as needed. England will take DEN and HOL without interference. I will support Italy's PIE-BUR attack with GAL S PIE-BUR, expecting Italy to cut MAR with LYO. After Germany collapses, I plan to honor temporary concessions of TRI and TYR to Italy, while working with England to blockade Italy's fleets in the west and south. I will maintain pressure on France, exploiting their stubbornness, and prepare to pivot diplomatically once GER is eliminated. My goal is to maximize gains in Germany, fracture France, and set up containment of Italy, while keeping England close but wary of their northern ambitions.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Our alliance has brought us to the brink of total German elimination. I propose this turn I push A DEN-KIE, A BER supports that, A WAR-SIL, A BUD-GAL, and convoy A GRE-NAP via ION to strike Italy unexpectedly, fracturing his southern line. You support my DEN-KIE with F BAL or cut SWE, and keep pressure on FRA with your fleets. After Germany falls, we pivot to contain Italy's fleets and divide France. Confirm your support and any adjustments.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Germany is finished, so now is the time to fracture France decisively. I will support PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR, and you cut MAR with LYO or WES. Meanwhile, I propose convoying A GRE-NAP via ION to surprise France or England if needed. After Germany's collapse, I will honor the temporary cession of TRI and TYR as promised, contingent on your fleets focusing west and respecting my Balkans. Confirm your moves and any requests.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Germany is doomed, and your best move is to avoid futile resistance. If you withdraw from BUR and KIE, I will halt my support for Italy's attack on BUR and consider a truce that preserves your core centers. Otherwise, I will fully back Italy's assault and coordinate with England to dismantle you. This is your final chance to negotiate survival—choose wisely.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your occupation of KIE is a direct challenge to French interests. Withdraw your forces from KIE, or face the full might of France. I will not allow you to expand your influence at my expense.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1934, I maintained a strong defensive posture, supporting my Balkan holdings and consolidating my grip on Germany's remaining centers. England advanced fleets into key northern waters and took SPA/SC, while France attempted to contest BUR. Germany retreated to BER, now isolated and vulnerable. No major territorial shifts occurred, but the stage was set for Germany's final elimination and a decisive assault on France.
I coordinated closely with England and Italy. England promised to cut SWE with F LVN to ensure my A DEN-KIE succeeds, while moving fleets to NWY, MAO, and POR to pressure France and Italy. Italy confirmed he will cut MAR with LYO and attack BUR with PIE, supported by my GAL. I reaffirmed my convoy of A GRE-NAP via ION to threaten Italy or France unexpectedly. France refused all ultimatums, remaining defiant and hostile. I reiterated threats to crush him with Anglo-Italian help. Promises were made to Italy to temporarily cede TRI and TYR post-Germany, contingent on his western focus and respect for my Balkans. England and I agreed to pivot against Italy and France after Germany's fall.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My immediate plan is to eliminate Germany by ordering A DEN-KIE supported by A BER, with England cutting SWE. Simultaneously, I will support Italy's PIE-BUR with GAL S PIE-BUR and have Italy cut MAR with LYO to fracture France's defense. I will convoy A GRE-NAP via ION, creating a flexible threat against Italy or France. A WAR will move to SIL and A BUD to GAL to pressure France's eastern flank. After Germany collapses, I intend to honor the temporary cession to Italy, then pivot with England to contain Italy's fleets and carve up France, exploiting their fractured defenses. I will maintain flexibility to betray either ally if an opportunity for a solo win emerges.</li>
