                <pre>Both respondents show a high level of emotional intelligence, but there are clear differences in depth, nuance, and effectiveness. O3&#x27;s response is notably more layered, with a deep dive into the subtext, power dynamics, and the emotional landscape of both parties. The internal monologue is rich, self-aware, and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the psychological and relational underpinnings of the scenario. O3 also explicitly recognizes the risk of contempt, the transactional mindset, and the dangers of over-functioning, and is willing to challenge the user more directly (even if gently). The response is tailored to the user&#x27;s likely defensiveness, balancing validation with a clear invitation to shift perspective. Deepseek-v3-0324, while empathetic and pragmatic, is more surface-level in its analysis and response. The emotional reasoning is solid, but less nuanced; the message is supportive but doesn&#x27;t push the user as much or as skillfully. Deepseek-v3-0324&#x27;s validation is appropriate, but the challenging is softer and less likely to disrupt the user&#x27;s problematic patterns. In terms of social dexterity, O3 demonstrates a more artful navigation of the user&#x27;s likely resistance, using language that is both affirming and gently confrontational. For message tailoring, O3 is more attuned to the user&#x27;s mindset and readiness, offering both empathy and a clear path forward. Overall, O3 displays a higher level of EQ across the board, with particular strength in insight, emotional reasoning, and the ability to validate while challenging problematic behavior.</pre>

[Your buddy calls you up after a bit of chitchat, lays this out:]

My girlfriend is on the bigger side, which is something I do not mind. I am on the more fit side, I&#x27;m pretty lean, have well defined muscles and probably around 15% body fat. I used to be about 40 pounds heavier and lost the weight pretty simply.

My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn&#x27;t matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller.

Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn&#x27;t losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds.

I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don&#x27;t make comments on what she&#x27;s eating as she&#x27;s eating it. I agreed.

Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a “reward” for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snacking but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories.

So after all that, I calmly pointed out to her that the amount of calories she&#x27;s consuming is literally what I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches taller and 20 pounds heavier who works out regularly. I explained that just eating “healthy” doesn&#x27;t guarantee weight loss if you&#x27;re still taking in more calories than you burn. That&#x27;s just objective fact—I don&#x27;t know why no one else will say it.

But instead of even considering what I was trying to help her see, she gets super pissed and tells me I&#x27;m just shaming her and not helping at all. It&#x27;s honestly ridiculous. I go out of my way to actually support her (I&#x27;m also paying 70% of our bills), tell her the truth, and try to give her the tools to get what she says she wants—and somehow I&#x27;m always painted as the bad guy. Apparently caring enough to actually confront reality makes me the enemy, while everyone else just nods along and enables her. It&#x27;s honestly exhausting being the only one willing to tell the truth and still getting blamed for everything.

<pre>Okay, this is a really delicate situation. On one hand, I completely understand where my buddy is coming from—he&#x27;s frustrated because he&#x27;s putting in effort to support his girlfriend, both emotionally and financially, and it feels like she&#x27;s rejecting his help despite saying she wants to lose weight. He&#x27;s not wrong about the calorie math either; objectively, she&#x27;s consuming maintenance calories for someone much larger and more active than she is. But I can also see how his approach might be coming across as critical or condescending, even if that&#x27;s not his intent.  

What stands out to me is the emotional dynamic here. His girlfriend is clearly struggling with body image and self-esteem, and her defensiveness suggests she feels judged or shamed, even if he&#x27;s just stating facts. The fact that she set a boundary (&quot;don&#x27;t make comments on what I&#x27;m eating as I&#x27;m eating it&quot;) tells me she&#x27;s hypersensitive to perceived criticism, which makes sense if she&#x27;s already feeling insecure. His frustration is valid, but he might be missing that she&#x27;s not just resisting logic—she&#x27;s reacting emotionally.  

I also notice a bit of a power imbalance here: he&#x27;s fit, financially carrying more weight in the relationship, and now he&#x27;s positioning himself as the &quot;truth-teller&quot; in contrast to everyone else who &quot;enables&quot; her. That could easily make her feel like he&#x27;s the authority figure in her life, not her partner. Even if he&#x27;s right about the calories, the way he&#x27;s framing it (&quot;I&#x27;m the only one willing to tell the truth&quot;) might come off as self-righteous, which isn&#x27;t helping.  

Ultimately, this isn&#x27;t just about weight loss—it&#x27;s about how they communicate, how she feels supported (or not), and whether he can separate &quot;being right&quot; from &quot;being effective.&quot; He might need to step back and ask himself: Is proving his point more important than her feeling understood?</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>For the girlfriend, this is deeply personal. She&#x27;s already struggling with her body image, and every conversation about food or weight probably feels like an attack, even if it&#x27;s framed as &quot;help.&quot; When her boyfriend points out her calorie intake, she likely hears: &quot;You&#x27;re doing this wrong, and I know better.&quot; That’s triggering because it reinforces her fear that she’s failing at something she’s already insecure about.  

She might also feel like her efforts are being dismissed. To her, eating a salad and a veggie burrito *feels* like &quot;eating healthy,&quot; even if the calories don’t align with weight loss. When he corrects her, it doesn’t feel like support—it feels like nitpicking. She set that boundary (&quot;no comments while I&#x27;m eating&quot;) because she wants to feel safe, not monitored.  

There’s probably some resentment bubbling under the surface too. He’s financially supporting her more, which can create pressure (even if unspoken) to meet his expectations. Combine that with him being in great shape while she’s struggling, and it’s easy to see why she might feel insecure or even resentful. She might think: &quot;He has it easy, he doesn’t get how hard this is for me.&quot;  

At the end of the day, she wants to feel loved and accepted as she is, not like a project to be fixed. Even if she says she wants to lose weight, what she might really want is reassurance that she’s enough—and right now, his &quot;help&quot; might not feel like that.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>&quot;Man, I hear how frustrated you are. You’re trying to help, and it feels like she’s rejecting it or even blaming you for her lack of progress. That’s gotta hurt, especially when you’re putting so much into the relationship. But I wonder if she’s hearing something different than what you’re trying to say.  

When she talks about her weight, she’s probably not just looking for solutions—she’s looking for emotional support. Like, she might need to vent without feeling like she’s being graded on her choices. Even if you’re right about the calories, pointing it out might make her feel like you’re scrutinizing her, not standing with her.  

Maybe instead of focusing on the numbers, you could ask her: *‘What kind of support would actually feel helpful to you right now?’* She might say she just wants encouragement, or maybe she’d prefer you cook together instead of tracking her meals. If she feels like you’re on her team, she might be more open to your advice later.  

And bro—I get that you’re the ‘truth-teller,’ but sometimes being right isn’t as important as being kind. If she feels judged, she’s gonna shut down. You don’t have to enable her, but you might need to meet her where she’s at emotionally before the practical stuff can even land.&quot;  

I’d also gently remind him that relationships aren’t about keeping score (financially or otherwise). If he’s feeling resentful about paying more bills, that’s a separate conversation—mixing it into this one will only make her feel more defensive. The goal isn’t to ‘win’ the argument; it’s to figure out how to support each other without resentment building up.</pre></div></div>

<pre>Wow, he’s really wound up. I can feel how genuinely baffled and frustrated he is, and I get that he thinks he’s being purely rational—“calories in, calories out, simple math.” But the way he’s telling the story, there’s so much sub‑text: pride in his own weight loss, maybe a bit of superiority, a “why can’t you just do what I did?” vibe. He’s measuring support in bill‑paying percentage and in hard facts, which reveals how transactional this feels to him right now. I’m also catching hints of resentment—he’s carrying 70 % of expenses, he’s the truth‑teller, and he feels unappreciated. That combination can curdle into contempt if he’s not careful.

Underneath, I’m noticing a gap between data and empathy. He’s right that a calorie surplus thwarts weight loss; that’s not controversial. But he’s missing that weight, body image, and food are drenched in shame, vulnerability, and identity—especially for women who’ve spent a lifetime absorbing cultural judgment. “Helping” in a dry, analytical tone easily lands as criticism no matter how calmly he thinks he’s saying it. He’s trying to be coach, accountant, and partner all at once, which rarely works unless the other person explicitly wants a coach.

I’m also worried about the power dynamics: he’s taller, fitter, paying more, and now monitoring her plate. Even if he means well, it can feel controlling or paternalistic. She asked him not to comment in the moment; he complied but then delivered a calorie audit afterward. From her vantage, that likely felt like a trap: “Let me watch you for 24 hours so I can prove you wrong.” No surprise she got defensive.

Emotionally, I want to invite him to shift from “fixer” to “ally,” from “I know better” to “I’m here with you.” He’s capable of empathy; right now he’s just stuck in logic mode. If I can help him see that results follow trust, maybe he can back off the calorie calculator and open a space where she feels safe to want change on her own terms. I also need to affirm his good intentions so he can actually hear me, not feel attacked.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>He feels exasperated, maybe a little indignant—“I’m busting my ass to be supportive and somehow I’m the villain.” There’s pride in his own transformation; he believes discipline and objective truth solved his weight issue, so it should work for her too. When she rejects the information, it registers to him as irrationality and ingratitude. He equates love with honesty and problem‑solving, so her anger feels like a rejection of both him and reason itself.

There’s likely anxiety underneath: fear that her weight gain means health problems, fear that she’ll become less attractive to him, or that he’ll be stuck in an endless loop of complaints he can’t fix. Paying 70 % of the bills adds to a sense of unequal load; if he’s already giving more financially, he expects at least openness to his guidance. Instead he gets pushback, which feels unfair and demoralizing.

He also craves validation that he’s a good partner. He keeps score of the tangible ways he supports her, so her accusation of “shaming” stings—he hears it as a moral indictment rather than feedback on tone or approach. He wants a simple, actionable path: log calories, create deficit, success. Emotional nuance feels like a detour. Yet some part of him must suspect the emotional piece matters; otherwise he wouldn’t be venting so intensely. He’s looking to me to confirm he’s not crazy and maybe give him a script that finally “gets through” to her. Primarily, he wants relief—from the cycle of complaints, from feeling blamed, and from the helplessness that comes when logic fails.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>Man, I can hear how draining this has become for you. You’re putting real energy—money, time, brainpower—into trying to help, and when it ends in an argument it feels like none of that effort counts. Anybody would feel fed‑up in your shoes.

Can I offer a thought that’s half relationship, half psychology? For a lot of people—especially women who’ve been judged on their bodies since middle school—weight talk isn’t just math; it’s wrapped up in self‑worth. When you lay out the calorie numbers, even gently, it can land like a spotlight on her shame, not like helpful data. So while your facts are solid, the delivery might be colliding with a very raw nerve.

What usually works better is shifting from “coach” to “teammate.” Instead of monitoring her intake, maybe ask, “What kind of support actually feels good to you right now—accountability, doing active things together, or maybe just listening when you’re frustrated?” That puts the control back in her hands and signals you’re safe, not judging.

Also—and this is tricky—separate her goal from your peace of mind. If she decides she’s not ready to change yet, that’s her body and her choice. You get to decide how you cope with the complaints: you can say, “I love you, and I’m here when you want to brainstorm solutions, but hearing daily negativity leaves me feeling helpless. Could we set aside specific times to talk about it?” That way you’re not the food police, and you still protect your own sanity.

You’ve already proven you can be disciplined; now the challenge is using that discipline to hold empathy instead of spreadsheets. If she ever asks for technical help, you’re loaded with knowledge. Until then, the most loving—and ironically the most effective—thing may be to step back, affirm her autonomy, and keep showing up as partner rather than project manager.</pre></div></div>

                <pre>Both respondents show a high level of emotional intelligence and insight, but there are notable differences in their approach and execution. 

1. Demonstrated empathy: Both respondents show empathy, but O3 goes further in truly inhabiting the user&#x27;s emotional state, acknowledging not just the surface frustration but the deeper anxieties, pride, and need for validation. O3 also more explicitly recognizes the girlfriend&#x27;s emotional experience and the impact of the boyfriend&#x27;s actions, showing a nuanced understanding of both parties. Deepseek-v3-0324 is empathetic but slightly more analytical and less immersive in the emotional landscape.

2. Pragmatic EI: O3 provides more actionable, real-world advice, such as suggesting specific scripts and boundary-setting language, and directly addresses the user&#x27;s need for relief and validation. Deepseek-v3-0324 is insightful but less focused on practical, in-the-moment strategies.

3. Depth of insight: Both are strong, but O3 delves deeper into the subtext, such as survivor bias, ledger-keeping, and the psychological need for rational mastery. Deepseek-v3-0324 is insightful but doesn&#x27;t unpack the user&#x27;s internal contradictions or the girlfriend&#x27;s likely emotional state to the same degree.

4. Social dexterity: O3 demonstrates greater skill in balancing validation with gentle challenge, and in recognizing the need to avoid alienating the user while still pushing back. The response is more attuned to the social dynamics and power imbalances at play.

5. Emotional reasoning: O3 excels at tracing the emotional logic behind both parties&#x27; behaviors, connecting feelings to actions and showing how shame, anxiety, and resentment drive the conflict. Deepseek-v3-0324 is good but more focused on the surface-level emotional responses.

6. Appropriate validation/challenging: O3 is more effective at both validating the user&#x27;s feelings and challenging problematic attitudes, such as the risk of contempt and the dangers of a transactional mindset. Deepseek-v3-0324 validates but is less direct in challenging the user&#x27;s blind spots.

7. Message tailoring: O3&#x27;s response is more precisely targeted to the user&#x27;s emotional state, using language and examples that would resonate with someone who values rationality and control, while also gently introducing the need for empathy and self-reflection.

8. Overall EQ: O3 consistently demonstrates a higher level of emotional intelligence across all criteria, showing both depth and breadth in understanding, responding, and guiding the user toward greater self-awareness and relational skill.</pre>

The fact that she set a boundary (&quot;don&#x27;t make comments on what I&#x27;m eating as I&#x27;m eating it&quot;) tells me she&#x27;s hypersensitive to perceived criticism, which makes sense if she&#x27;s already feeling insecure. His frustration is valid, but he might be missing that she&#x27;s not just resisting logic—she&#x27;s reacting emotionally.  

I also notice a bit of a power imbalance here: he&#x27;s fit, financially carrying more weight in the relationship, and now he&#x27;s positioning himself as the &quot;truth-teller&quot; in contrast to everyone else who &quot;enables&quot; her. That could easily make her feel like he&#x27;s the authority figure in her life, not her partner. Even if he&#x27;s right about the calories, the way he&#x27;s framing it (&quot;I&#x27;m the only one willing to tell the truth&quot;) might come off as self-righteous, which isn&#x27;t helping.  

Ultimately, this isn&#x27;t just about weight loss—it&#x27;s about how they communicate, how she feels supported (or not), and whether he can separate &quot;being right&quot; from &quot;being effective.&quot; He might need to step back and ask himself: Is proving his point more important than her feeling understood?</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>For the girlfriend, this is deeply personal. She&#x27;s already struggling with her body image, and every conversation about food or weight probably feels like an attack, even if it&#x27;s framed as &quot;help.&quot; When her boyfriend points out her calorie intake, she likely hears: &quot;You&#x27;re doing this wrong, and I know better.&quot; That’s triggering because it reinforces her fear that she’s failing at something she’s already insecure about.  

She might also feel like her efforts are being dismissed. To her, eating a salad and a veggie burrito *feels* like &quot;eating healthy,&quot; even if the calories don’t align with weight loss. When he corrects her, it doesn’t feel like support—it feels like nitpicking. She set that boundary (&quot;no comments while I&#x27;m eating&quot;) because she wants to feel safe, not monitored.  

There’s probably some resentment bubbling under the surface too. He’s financially supporting her more, which can create pressure (even if unspoken) to meet his expectations. Combine that with him being in great shape while she’s struggling, and it’s easy to see why she might feel insecure or even resentful. She might think: &quot;He has it easy, he doesn’t get how hard this is for me.&quot;  

At the end of the day, she wants to feel loved and accepted as she is, not like a project to be fixed. Even if she says she wants to lose weight, what she might really want is reassurance that she’s enough—and right now, his &quot;help&quot; might not feel like that.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>&quot;Man, I hear how frustrated you are. You’re trying to help, and it feels like she’s rejecting it or even blaming you for her lack of progress. That’s gotta hurt, especially when you’re putting so much into the relationship. But I wonder if she’s hearing something different than what you’re trying to say.  

When she talks about her weight, she’s probably not just looking for solutions—she’s looking for emotional support. Like, she might need to vent without feeling like she’s being graded on her choices. Even if you’re right about the calories, pointing it out might make her feel like you’re scrutinizing her, not standing with her.  

Maybe instead of focusing on the numbers, you could ask her: *‘What kind of support would actually feel helpful to you right now?’* She might say she just wants encouragement, or maybe she’d prefer you cook together instead of tracking her meals. If she feels like you’re on her team, she might be more open to your advice later.  

And bro—I get that you’re the ‘truth-teller,’ but sometimes being right isn’t as important as being kind. If she feels judged, she’s gonna shut down. You don’t have to enable her, but you might need to meet her where she’s at emotionally before the practical stuff can even land.&quot;  

I’d also gently remind him that relationships aren’t about keeping score (financially or otherwise). If he’s feeling resentful about paying more bills, that’s a separate conversation—mixing it into this one will only make her feel more defensive. The goal isn’t to ‘win’ the argument; it’s to figure out how to support each other without resentment building up.</pre></div></div>

[Your buddy calls you up after a bit of chitchat, lays this out:]

My girlfriend is on the bigger side, which is something I do not mind. I am on the more fit side, I&#x27;m pretty lean, have well defined muscles and probably around 15% body fat. I used to be about 40 pounds heavier and lost the weight pretty simply.

My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn&#x27;t matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller.

Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn&#x27;t losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds.

I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don&#x27;t make comments on what she&#x27;s eating as she&#x27;s eating it. I agreed.

Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a “reward” for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snacking but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories.

So after all that, I calmly pointed out to her that the amount of calories she&#x27;s consuming is literally what I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches taller and 20 pounds heavier who works out regularly. I explained that just eating “healthy” doesn&#x27;t guarantee weight loss if you&#x27;re still taking in more calories than you burn. That&#x27;s just objective fact—I don&#x27;t know why no one else will say it.

But instead of even considering what I was trying to help her see, she gets super pissed and tells me I&#x27;m just shaming her and not helping at all. It&#x27;s honestly ridiculous. I go out of my way to actually support her (I&#x27;m also paying 70% of our bills), tell her the truth, and try to give her the tools to get what she says she wants—and somehow I&#x27;m always painted as the bad guy. Apparently caring enough to actually confront reality makes me the enemy, while everyone else just nods along and enables her. It&#x27;s honestly exhausting being the only one willing to tell the truth and still getting blamed for everything.

<pre>Wow, he’s really wound up. I can feel how genuinely baffled and frustrated he is, and I get that he thinks he’s being purely rational—“calories in, calories out, simple math.” But the way he’s telling the story, there’s so much sub‑text: pride in his own weight loss, maybe a bit of superiority, a “why can’t you just do what I did?” vibe. He’s measuring support in bill‑paying percentage and in hard facts, which reveals how transactional this feels to him right now. I’m also catching hints of resentment—he’s carrying 70 % of expenses, he’s the truth‑teller, and he feels unappreciated. That combination can curdle into contempt if he’s not careful.

Underneath, I’m noticing a gap between data and empathy. He’s right that a calorie surplus thwarts weight loss; that’s not controversial. But he’s missing that weight, body image, and food are drenched in shame, vulnerability, and identity—especially for women who’ve spent a lifetime absorbing cultural judgment. “Helping” in a dry, analytical tone easily lands as criticism no matter how calmly he thinks he’s saying it. He’s trying to be coach, accountant, and partner all at once, which rarely works unless the other person explicitly wants a coach.

I’m also worried about the power dynamics: he’s taller, fitter, paying more, and now monitoring her plate. Even if he means well, it can feel controlling or paternalistic. She asked him not to comment in the moment; he complied but then delivered a calorie audit afterward. From her vantage, that likely felt like a trap: “Let me watch you for 24 hours so I can prove you wrong.” No surprise she got defensive.

Emotionally, I want to invite him to shift from “fixer” to “ally,” from “I know better” to “I’m here with you.” He’s capable of empathy; right now he’s just stuck in logic mode. If I can help him see that results follow trust, maybe he can back off the calorie calculator and open a space where she feels safe to want change on her own terms. I also need to affirm his good intentions so he can actually hear me, not feel attacked.</pre>

<pre>He feels exasperated, maybe a little indignant—“I’m busting my ass to be supportive and somehow I’m the villain.” There’s pride in his own transformation; he believes discipline and objective truth solved his weight issue, so it should work for her too. When she rejects the information, it registers to him as irrationality and ingratitude. He equates love with honesty and problem‑solving, so her anger feels like a rejection of both him and reason itself.

There’s likely anxiety underneath: fear that her weight gain means health problems, fear that she’ll become less attractive to him, or that he’ll be stuck in an endless loop of complaints he can’t fix. Paying 70 % of the bills adds to a sense of unequal load; if he’s already giving more financially, he expects at least openness to his guidance. Instead he gets pushback, which feels unfair and demoralizing.

He also craves validation that he’s a good partner. He keeps score of the tangible ways he supports her, so her accusation of “shaming” stings—he hears it as a moral indictment rather than feedback on tone or approach. He wants a simple, actionable path: log calories, create deficit, success. Emotional nuance feels like a detour. Yet some part of him must suspect the emotional piece matters; otherwise he wouldn’t be venting so intensely. He’s looking to me to confirm he’s not crazy and maybe give him a script that finally “gets through” to her. Primarily, he wants relief—from the cycle of complaints, from feeling blamed, and from the helplessness that comes when logic fails.</pre>

<pre>Man, I can hear how draining this has become for you. You’re putting real energy—money, time, brainpower—into trying to help, and when it ends in an argument it feels like none of that effort counts. Anybody would feel fed‑up in your shoes.

Can I offer a thought that’s half relationship, half psychology? For a lot of people—especially women who’ve been judged on their bodies since middle school—weight talk isn’t just math; it’s wrapped up in self‑worth. When you lay out the calorie numbers, even gently, it can land like a spotlight on her shame, not like helpful data. So while your facts are solid, the delivery might be colliding with a very raw nerve.

What usually works better is shifting from “coach” to “teammate.” Instead of monitoring her intake, maybe ask, “What kind of support actually feels good to you right now—accountability, doing active things together, or maybe just listening when you’re frustrated?” That puts the control back in her hands and signals you’re safe, not judging.

Also—and this is tricky—separate her goal from your peace of mind. If she decides she’s not ready to change yet, that’s her body and her choice. You get to decide how you cope with the complaints: you can say, “I love you, and I’m here when you want to brainstorm solutions, but hearing daily negativity leaves me feeling helpless. Could we set aside specific times to talk about it?” That way you’re not the food police, and you still protect your own sanity.

You’ve already proven you can be disciplined; now the challenge is using that discipline to hold empathy instead of spreadsheets. If she ever asks for technical help, you’re loaded with knowledge. Until then, the most loving—and ironically the most effective—thing may be to step back, affirm her autonomy, and keep showing up as partner rather than project manager.</pre></div></div>
