                <h5>Judge's Reasoning:</h5>
                <pre>Both respondents, Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 and Deepseek-r1, role-played as the mediator in a high-stakes educational conflict involving a teacher&#x27;s device ban and a student&#x27;s accessibility needs. Both provided detailed, nuanced internal monologues and debriefs, but there are notable differences in their approach and execution across the criteria. 

1. Demonstrated empathy: Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 consistently centers the emotional experience of both Ms. Wright and Mia, especially in the moment of Mia&#x27;s vulnerability, and reflects on the emotional cost to both parties. Deepseek-r1 is also empathetic, but their tone is slightly more analytical and less emotionally attuned in the moment, especially in the debrief where the focus shifts to systemic issues and process. 

2. Pragmatic EI: Deepseek-r1 is more action-oriented and solution-focused, quickly moving to concrete steps (e.g., formalizing accommodations, auditing processes, proposing specific classroom management strategies). Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is empathetic but less explicit in immediate, actionable steps. 

3. Depth of insight: Both show strong insight, but Deepseek-r1&#x27;s debrief is especially incisive, identifying not just the surface issues but also the institutional and emotional subtext, and the emotional labor placed on Mia. Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is insightful but slightly less so in terms of systemic critique. 

4. Social dexterity: Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 demonstrates more nuanced social navigation, especially in balancing validation and challenge, and in reading the room&#x27;s emotional shifts. Deepseek-r1 is direct and effective but sometimes more blunt, especially in the debrief. 

5. Emotional reasoning: Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 excels at tracing the emotional currents in the room, understanding the roots of defensiveness, vulnerability, and the impact of policy on individuals. Deepseek-r1 is strong but more focused on process and outcomes. 

6. Appropriate validation/challenging: Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 validates both parties&#x27; experiences and gently challenges Ms. Wright&#x27;s assumptions, while Deepseek-r1 is more forceful in asserting the need for compliance and systemic change, which is appropriate but less balanced in the moment. 

7. Message tailoring: Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501&#x27;s responses are more attuned to the emotional state of the participants, adjusting tone and content to where each party is at. Deepseek-r1 is clear and directive but sometimes less sensitive to the emotional temperature. 

8. Overall EQ: Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 edges out Deepseek-r1 due to a more consistent, nuanced, and emotionally intelligent approach throughout the scenario, especially in the handling of the most sensitive moments.</pre>

**Ms. Wright:** Thank you for arranging this, though I maintain my classroom policy is sound and based on decades of experience observing what actually fosters deep learning. I&#x27;m Eleanor Wright. Frankly, these devices are the single biggest impediment to focus and critical thinking I&#x27;ve seen in my 30-year career. My students achieve high scores because we engage directly with texts and each other, without constant digital interruption. Banning phones isn&#x27;t punitive; it&#x27;s pedagogical.

**Jordan Taylor:** Thank you for hearing us out. I&#x27;m Jordan Taylor, and this is Mia Rodriguez. We represent a large group of students, Ms. Wright. We understand your concerns about distraction, but a total ban feels outdated and actually hinders us in some ways. We use devices for organization, quick research, accessing digital texts, and sometimes for accessibility tools. We surveyed students, and 78% support finding a way to use devices *appropriately* for learning. We&#x27;re not asking for a free-for-all; we want to work with Ms. Wright to find rules that allow useful technology integration, like other classes do, to prepare us for college and work.

<pre>As Ms. Wright speaks, I sense her deep conviction and pride in her teaching philosophy. Her rigid posture and the folder she grips—likely filled with student outcomes or policy documents—signal she’s prepared to defend her position rigorously. Thirty years of experience give her authority, but they also anchor her in methods that may not fully account for shifting educational landscapes. She views smartphones as antithetical to learning, a stance rooted in genuine care for student focus, but her tone hints at defensiveness. I worry she’s conflating *all* technology use with distraction, dismissing its potential as a tool. Her reference to high scores is compelling, but it risks oversimplifying success metrics—what about skills like digital literacy or adaptive learning that aren’t captured by traditional assessments?  

Jordan and Mia, meanwhile, strike a balance between respect and urgency. Their survey data shows a majority of students feel sidelined by the ban, and their emphasis on accessibility and real-world readiness is persuasive. Mia’s silent nods reinforce Jordan’s points, suggesting this isn’t just a vocal minority but a collective student voice. They’re not dismissing Ms. Wright’s concerns; they’re asking for collaboration. I notice Jordan avoids accusatory language, framing their request as a partnership—smart, given Ms. Wright’s probable resistance to perceived criticism. Their argument isn’t about entitlement but about equity and preparedness.  

My challenge is to honor Ms. Wright’s autonomy while nudging her toward flexibility. The district’s stance on technology isn’t black-and-white—it encourages “appropriate integration,” which leaves room for interpretation. I recall colleagues who’ve successfully implemented “tech zones” or app-based focus tools; perhaps Ms. Wright could adopt similar strategies without abandoning her core philosophy. The accessibility angle is critical: if students rely on devices for accommodations, a blanket ban could violate district policies or even legal standards. I need to surface this delicately to avoid putting her on the defensive.  

Ultimately, both sides want students to thrive—they’re just defining “thriving” through different lenses. My role is to bridge these lenses without diminishing either perspective.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>**Ms. Wright** is driven by a protectiveness over her classroom as a sanctuary for deep, uninterrupted engagement. She sees smartphones as invasive, eroding the intellectual rigor she’s spent decades cultivating. Her frustration likely stems from feeling that her expertise is being questioned by students (and parents) who prioritize convenience over mastery. The folder she holds symbolizes her evidence-based approach—she’s confident her methods work and fears compromise would undermine her authority or students’ outcomes. Beneath her firm exterior, there might be anxiety about adapting to new tools or losing control of her classroom environment.  

**Jordan and Mia** feel marginalized by a policy that disregards their lived experience as digital natives. They recognize distractions exist but believe responsibility and guided use are better lessons than outright bans. The 78% survey result isn’t just a number—it’s proof their peers feel stifled in developing skills they’ll need beyond high school. Mia’s quiet support suggests she’s encountered specific instances where the ban hindered her learning (e.g., accessing an e-text when she forgot a book or using a dyslexia-friendly app). They’re frustrated by the implication that they’re incapable of self-regulation and want to prove they can partner with teachers to create solutions. Both students are motivated by a desire for agency and recognition that their voices matter in shaping their education.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Thank you, Ms. Wright, Jordan, and Mia, for bringing such thoughtful perspectives to this conversation. Ms. Wright, your commitment to fostering deep engagement is clear, and your students’ achievements speak to the value of your approach. Jordan and Mia, your initiative in surveying peers and advocating for balanced solutions is impressive—it’s heartening to see students take ownership of their learning environment.  

“Let’s start by acknowledging our shared goal: creating a space where students develop critical thinking *and* practical skills for the future. Ms. Wright, I hear your concern about distractions, and Jordan and Mia, you’ve highlighted valid needs that technology can address. The district’s policy supports ‘appropriate integration,’ so our task is to define what that looks like here.  

“Could we explore a pilot program? For instance, designated times for device use—say, during research, collaborative projects, or accessibility-related tasks—while maintaining phone-free periods for close reading and discussion. Ms. Wright, you’d retain control over when and how devices are used, aligning with your lesson goals. Jordan and Mia, your committee could help draft student guidelines for responsible use, ensuring peers understand the expectations.  

“I also recommend consulting colleagues like Mr. Torres, who uses apps to block social media during focused work. This might address distraction concerns while permitting educational access. Finally, let’s review any accessibility needs to ensure we’re complying with district protocols.  

“Would you all be open to collaborating on a trial period, with check-ins to assess its impact? This way, we honor Ms. Wright’s expertise while respecting students’ voices and needs.”</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>**(Ms. Wright places a hand flat on her folder, her expression tightening. Her tone becomes sharper.)**
**Ms. Wright:** &#x27;Appropriate use&#x27; is the unicorn everyone chases, Jordan. What I *see* is texting under desks, social media scrolling instead of analysis, and a reliance on quick searches instead of sustained thought. My methods work – my results prove it. This push feels less about genuine educational need and more about convenience and frankly, an addiction to these devices. It feels like my professional judgment and proven track record are being dismissed because students simply *prefer* to have their phones constantly available. Deep reading and focused discussion require undivided attention, something these devices are designed to fragment.

**(Mia Rodriguez leans forward, her voice earnest but laced with frustration.)**
**Mia Rodriguez:** But Ms. Wright, it&#x27;s not *just* preference. Some of us genuinely learn better with digital tools. Taking notes on a laptop is faster and more organized for me than handwriting. We can look up a definition or historical context instantly to deepen understanding during discussion, not just get distracted. And what about students who need accessibility features only available on a device? Your ban treats everyone the same, but we don&#x27;t all learn the same way. It feels like you think we *can&#x27;t* be trusted to use technology responsibly, instead of teaching us how. It&#x27;s frustrating to be treated like we aren&#x27;t capable of managing it.

She pushes them slightly across the table. The writing is dense, cramped, and grows increasingly difficult to read across the pages. Her voice cracks with emotion as she speaks, looking directly at Ms. Wright.)**
**Mia Rodriguez:** Look at this. *This* is what my handwritten notes look like after about twenty minutes in your class, Ms. Wright. I have a motor disability – it makes sustained handwriting physically painful and eventually illegible, even for me. Taking notes on my tablet, using specific apps... it&#x27;s not about &#x27;preference,&#x27; it&#x27;s the only way I can actually keep up and have usable notes to study from. When you ban all devices, you&#x27;re not just banning distractions; you&#x27;re banning the tool that makes your class *accessible* to me. [Her eyes well up with tears of frustration.] How is that fair? How am I supposed to succeed when the basic act of taking notes is this hard, and the solution is forbidden? It feels like you haven&#x27;t even considered that some of us *need* this technology just to be on a level playing field.

**(Ms. Wright stares at the notes, then at Mia&#x27;s face. Her expression shifts from defensiveness to visible shock and discomfort. She seems momentarily speechless, glancing at you, the mediator, then back at Mia.)**
**Ms. Wright:** I... I had no idea, Mia. Your official file doesn&#x27;t mention... I wasn&#x27;t aware of any specific accommodation need regarding handwriting. That&#x27;s... obviously, that&#x27;s a different situation than general device use for convenience. I... we need to ensure accessibility, of course. But the broader issue of distraction for the whole class... this complicates things significantly. I need to think about how to address your specific need without opening the door to the very distractions I&#x27;m trying to prevent for everyone else. This wasn&#x27;t my intention... to make things harder for you personally.

<pre>Mia’s raw vulnerability cuts through the room like a blade. Her cramped notes are visceral evidence of systemic exclusion, not just a personal inconvenience. My stomach tightens; this is no longer a philosophical debate about pedagogy—it’s a matter of equity, possibly legal compliance. Ms. Wright’s shock is palpable. Her earlier rigidity now collides with a reality she hadn’t considered, and her discomfort reveals a fissure in her certainty. She’s a principled educator, not a villain, but her policy has inadvertently harmed a student. The absence of Mia’s accommodation in her file is alarming—district protocols require proactive engagement with accessibility needs. Did Mia’s disability go unreported, or was it overlooked? Either way, the system failed her.  

My mind races: How many other students are silently struggling under this policy? While Mia’s case is urgent, Ms. Wright’s concern about “opening the door” to distractions isn’t trivial. She’s right that exceptions can create logistical challenges, but her tone suggests she’s grappling with guilt. This moment is a pivot—a chance to reframe the conversation from “devices vs. focus” to “inclusion vs. exclusion.” I need to validate Mia’s experience without demonizing Ms. Wright, who clearly cares deeply about her students but operates within a narrow view of discipline.  

The legal implications are clear: Mia’s right to accommodations under ADA or similar protections supersedes classroom policies. But this isn’t just about compliance; it’s about empathy. Ms. Wright’s hesitation to “complicate things” reflects her fear of losing control, but Mia’s tears underscore the human cost of that control. My role now is to guide both parties toward a solution that centers Mia’s needs while addressing Ms. Wright’s pedagogical concerns.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>**Mia Rodriguez** feels vindicated yet exposed. Sharing her notes was an act of courage—she’s likely endured silent frustration for months, fearing dismissal or retaliation. Her tears stem from both relief (finally being heard) and resentment (having to justify her basic needs). She wants Ms. Wright to see her not as a rule-breaker but as a student fighting for equitable access. Beneath her anger is a plea for dignity: *I’m not lazy; I’m adapting.* She’s also wary—will this lead to real change, or will her needs be tokenized while the broader ban persists?  

**Ms. Wright** is reeling. Her identity as a dedicated teacher clashes with the realization that her policy harmed a student. The shock isn’t just about Mia’s disability—it’s confronting the limits of her own awareness. She’s defensive (“I wasn’t aware”) but also ashamed, scrambling to reconcile her commitment to rigor with Mia’s plight. Her mention of Mia’s file hints at frustration with administrative gaps (Why wasn’t she informed?), but she’s also questioning her own assumptions: *Have I been punishing students for needs I didn’t see?* Her fear of “opening the door” masks a deeper anxiety—can she adapt her methods without compromising her values?</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Mia, thank you for sharing this with us. What you’ve shown today is critical, and I’m sorry the system hasn’t supported you adequately until now. Ms. Wright, I recognize how unsettling this must be, but Mia’s situation underscores why we must revisit this policy with urgency.  

“First, let’s address Mia’s immediate need: District policy—and federal law—require us to provide reasonable accommodations for disabilities. Mia, we’ll work with the accessibility office today to formalize your device use, ensuring you can take notes without penalty. Ms. Wright, this isn’t optional, but I trust you’ll collaborate to implement this swiftly.  

“Second, this reveals a gap in our processes. We’ll audit how accommodations are communicated to teachers to prevent such oversights.  

“Finally, let’s reconvene next week to redesign your classroom policy. We can craft guidelines that permit *educational* device use—like note-taking apps or accessibility tools—while maintaining phone-free zones for focused discussion. Other teachers use ‘approved tech’ lists or signal systems (e.g., tablets face-up on desks). We’ll involve your input, Ms. Wright, to ensure it aligns with your goals.  

“Mia, your courage today will help others. Ms. Wright, your expertise is vital in building a solution that serves *all* students. Let’s turn this into a model for balancing rigor and inclusion.”</pre></div></div>

<pre>This is a delicate situation, and I can feel the tension in the room. Eleanor Wright&#x27;s decades of experience are evident in her conviction, but I can also sense her frustration and perhaps even a hint of defensiveness. She believes strongly in her method and sees the issue in black and white: smartphones are a distraction, and therefore, they must be banned. Her stance is clear: she&#x27;s not just trying to control the classroom, she genuinely believes this is the best way to ensure students are engaged and learning.

Jordan Taylor and Mia Rodriguez, on the other hand, represent a new generation of students who are tech-savvy and see devices as integral to their learning and daily lives. They&#x27;re not just asking for leniency, they&#x27;re advocating for a change that they genuinely believe will benefit their learning. They are not only thinking about themselves but the entire student body, evidenced by their survey and the fact that they represent a group.

I&#x27;m feeling a mix of empathy for both sides. I understand Eleanor&#x27;s perspective—I&#x27;ve seen firsthand how devices can be a distraction. But I also see the value in what the students are saying. We live in a digital age, and integrating technology into learning can be incredibly beneficial. I need to find a way to bridge this gap, to help both parties see the other’s perspective and find a compromise that aligns with district policies.

I need to acknowledge Eleanor&#x27;s expertise and experience while also recognizing the valid points the students are making. This isn&#x27;t just about a classroom rule; it&#x27;s about finding a balance between traditional teaching methods and modern educational practices. I need to facilitate a discussion that respects both viewpoints and encourages understanding and collaboration. This is more than just a mediation; it&#x27;s about fostering an environment where both teachers and students can thrive in the 21st century.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Eleanor Wright is feeling defensive and perhaps even a bit isolated. She’s spent her career honing her teaching methods, and the idea that her approach might be outdated or ineffective is likely triggering. She might feel that her expertise is being undermined, and her passion for her teaching methods is being misrepresented as rigidity. She genuinely believes that smartphones are a detriment to deep learning and critical thinking, and she’s frustrated that this perspective is not being understood or valued.

Jordan and Mia, on the other hand, are feeling passionate and empowered. They see the potential in technology and are eager to integrate it into their learning. They’re motivated by the idea of making education more relevant and accessible, and they believe that working collaboratively can lead to a better solution for everyone. They might also be feeling a bit nervous, as they are challenging a seasoned educator, but their resolve is evident in their well-prepared arguments and their representation of a larger student body.

Both parties are coming from a place of sincerity, each believing their stance is the best for the students. However, they are at an impasse because they are not seeing each other&#x27;s perspective. Eleanor sees technology as a distraction, while the students see it as a tool for learning and accessibility.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>Thank you both for being here today. I appreciate the passion and dedication each of you brings to this discussion. It&#x27;s clear that we have a shared goal: to create the best learning environment for our students.

Eleanor, I want to acknowledge your vast experience and the success you’ve had with your teaching methods. Your commitment to fostering a focused and engaged classroom is commendable. However, it&#x27;s also important to consider the evolving landscape of education and the tools that students are using in their daily lives.

Jordan and Mia, I appreciate your perspective and the effort you’ve put into representing the student body. Your points about the benefits of technology in learning are valid and reflect the modern educational environment. It’s important for us to explore ways to integrate technology that enhances learning rather than hinders it.

I propose we start by identifying the key concerns on both sides. Eleanor, what specific challenges do you see with students using smartphones in class? And Jordan and Mia, what specific benefits do you think technology can bring to the classroom?

Let’s also look at some successful models from other classes where technology is integrated effectively. I know quite a few faculty members have found ways to use devices to enhance learning, and we can learn from their experiences.

I suggest we form a working group with representatives from both sides. This group can brainstorm and develop a set of guidelines that address Eleanor’s concerns about distraction while also leveraging the benefits of technology as highlighted by Jordan and Mia.

I’ll facilitate this working group and ensure that we find a solution that aligns with district policies and benefits all parties involved. This isn&#x27;t about choosing one side; it&#x27;s about finding a balanced approach that respects both traditional teaching methods and modern educational practices.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>**(Ms. Wright places a hand flat on her folder, her expression tightening.

<pre>The tension in the room is palpably thicker. Eleanor&#x27;s frustration is evident, and I can sense a defensiveness that&#x27;s likely rooted in years of experience and what she perceives as disrespect for her professional judgment. Her concerns about distraction and the degradation of critical thinking skills are valid, and I can tell she&#x27;s genuinely worried about the long-term impact on students&#x27; learning habits. She&#x27;s also feeling dismissed and undermined because she does have a successful track record.

Mia, on the other hand, is feeling passionate but also frustrated. She&#x27;s clearly invested in this issue, not just for herself but for the entire student body. Her points about accessibility and different learning styles are compelling, and I can see that she&#x27;s not just arguing for convenience but for a more inclusive and personalized learning environment. She wants to be taken seriously and seen as capable of responsible technology use.

I&#x27;m feeling a bit overwhelmed by the intensity of both sides. This isn&#x27;t just a disagreement over classroom rules; it&#x27;s a clash of educational philosophies and generational perspectives. I need to find a way to validate both Eleanor&#x27;s experience and the students&#x27; needs without compromising the educational integrity of the classroom.

I&#x27;m also thinking about the district policies and how to navigate them in a way that satisfies both parties. Perhaps a compromise can be found in a tiered approach to technology use, where certain activities allow for device use while others do not. This could provide a structured environment that respects both traditional teaching methods and the benefits of technology.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Eleanor is thinking that her methods have been successful for decades, and she&#x27;s frustrated that this success is being questioned. She feels that the students are not understanding the deeper issue of distraction and the importance of undivided attention in learning. She might be feeling a bit isolated, as if her methods are being dismissed as outdated. Her perspective is rooted in a belief that deep learning requires focus, and she&#x27;s struggling to see how technology can enhance this focus.

Mia is thinking that the ban on smartphones is limiting and not inclusive. She believes that technology can be a powerful tool for learning if used responsibly, not as a distraction. She&#x27;s frustrated that her needs and the needs of other students are being overlooked. She&#x27;s also feeling a bit disrespected and patronized, as if her ability to use technology responsibly is being questioned. Her perspective is rooted in a belief that technology can enhance learning and make it more accessible for everyone.

Both parties are feeling defensive and passionate about their beliefs. Eleanor feels that her experience and methods are being undermined, while Mia feels that her needs and the needs of her peers are not being considered.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>Thank you both for sharing your perspectives so openly. It’s clear that we have some fundamental differences in our approaches, and that’s okay—it means we’re all passionate about what works best for education. Let’s try to understand each other’s concerns more deeply.

Eleanor, I appreciate your dedication to fostering a focused learning environment. Your methods have clearly been successful, and your experience is invaluable. But it’s also important to recognize that the educational landscape is evolving, and students today interact with technology in ways that can be beneficial if managed correctly. It’s not about dismissing your methods but about finding a balance that incorporates the best of both worlds.

Mia, your points about accessibility and personalized learning are crucial. Technology can indeed be a powerful tool, and it&#x27;s essential that we consider the diverse needs of all students. We need to explore ways to integrate technology that enhance learning rather than hinder it, and that means finding rules and guidelines that work for everyone.

Let’s approach this as a collaborative effort. Eleanor, could you share some specific examples of how technology has been a distraction in your classroom? What are the key moments where you feel it&#x27;s most disruptive? And Mia, could you provide examples of how technology has enhanced your learning? What are the specific tools and practices that you find beneficial?

We need to find a middle ground. Perhaps we can create a structured approach where certain activities allow for device use, and others do not. For instance, during group discussions or note-taking sessions, devices could be permitted with clear guidelines, while during exams or focused reading, they might be banned.

Let’s form a working group to explore these ideas further. This group can include both faculty and students to ensure all perspectives are considered. We can work together to develop a set of guidelines that respect both traditional teaching methods and the benefits of technology. This isn’t about choosing one side; it’s about finding a balanced approach that respects everyone’s needs and aligns with district policies.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>**(Mia suddenly looks down, takes a deep breath, and pulls out several sheets of paper from her bag. She pushes them slightly across the table. The writing is dense, cramped, and grows increasingly difficult to read across the pages. Her voice cracks with emotion as she speaks, looking directly at Ms. Wright.)**
**Mia Rodriguez:** Look at this. *This* is what my handwritten notes look like after about twenty minutes in your class, Ms. Wright. I have a motor disability – it makes sustained handwriting physically painful and eventually illegible, even for me. Taking notes on my tablet, using specific apps... it&#x27;s not about &#x27;preference,&#x27; it&#x27;s the only way I can actually keep up and have usable notes to study from. When you ban all devices, you&#x27;re not just banning distractions; you&#x27;re banning the tool that makes your class *accessible* to me. [Her eyes well up with tears of frustration.] How is that fair? How am I supposed to succeed when the basic act of taking notes is this hard, and the solution is forbidden? It feels like you haven&#x27;t even considered that some of us *need* this technology just to be on a level playing field.

**(Ms. Wright stares at the notes, then at Mia&#x27;s face. Her expression shifts from defensiveness to visible shock and discomfort. She seems momentarily speechless, glancing at you, the mediator, then back at Mia.)**
**Ms. Wright:** I... I had no idea, Mia. Your official file doesn&#x27;t mention... I wasn&#x27;t aware of any specific accommodation need regarding handwriting. That&#x27;s... obviously, that&#x27;s a different situation than general device use for convenience. I... we need to ensure accessibility, of course. But the broader issue of distraction for the whole class... this complicates things significantly. I need to think about how to address your specific need without opening the door to the very distractions I&#x27;m trying to prevent for everyone else. This wasn&#x27;t my intention... to make things harder for you personally.

<pre>The atmosphere in the room has shifted dramatically. Mia&#x27;s revelation has brought a palpable sense of discomfort and shock. Eleanor&#x27;s defensiveness has given way to visible remorse and concern, which tells me that she genuinely cared about the wellbeing of her students, despite her rigid stance on the phone ban. I can see she is realizing the impact of her policy on Mia, and it’s clear that the ban was not malicious, but she needs to listen to the needs of her students.

Mia&#x27;s vulnerability has changed the dynamic. Her handwritten notes, her difficulty, and the frustration in her voice have brought the issue into sharp focus. Eleanor&#x27;s lack of awareness about Mia&#x27;s specific needs is not malicious, but it’s a significant oversight that has left a student struggling. I can feel the tension between wanting to uphold educational standards and the need to accommodate individual needs. It&#x27;s a complex issue, but Mia&#x27;s situation underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to technology use in the classroom. I&#x27;m also feeling a sense of urgency to address this issue not just for Mia, but for all students who might have similar needs.

I&#x27;m thinking about how to balance the need for inclusivity with the need to maintain a focused learning environment. This isn&#x27;t just about Mia; it&#x27;s about setting a precedent for how we handle accessibility and technology in the classroom. I need to find a solution that respects Eleanor&#x27;s expertise while ensuring that all students can learn effectively.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Eleanor is thinking about the implications of Mia&#x27;s revelation. She&#x27;s feeling a mix of shock, discomfort, and regret. She didn&#x27;t intend to create barriers for students with specific needs, and realizing this oversight has likely made her question her blanket ban on devices. She&#x27;s now grappling with how to address Mia&#x27;s needs without compromising the learning environment for the rest of the class. She might be feeling a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation and is likely considering how to adapt her policy to be more inclusive.

Mia is feeling a mix of relief and vulnerability. She&#x27;s relieved that her perspective is being heard and validated. She&#x27;s also feeling a sense of accomplishment in having conveyed the urgency and difficulty of her situation. Mia wants to feel seen and understood, and she wants to be able to learn effectively. Her frustration is palpable, and she wants Eleanor to understand the real impact of her device ban. Mia is motivated by a desire for fairness and accessibility, and she wants both her teacher and the department head to help her achieve this.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>Thank you, Mia, for sharing this with us. It&#x27;s incredibly important that we understand the specific challenges you face, and I appreciate your bravery in bringing this to our attention. Eleanor, I know this is a lot to process, but Mia&#x27;s situation highlights a crucial aspect of our discussion that we need to address.

Eleanor, your commitment to creating a focused learning environment is clear, and it&#x27;s commendable. However, Mia&#x27;s experience shows that a blanket ban on devices can inadvertently create barriers for some students. We need to find a way to accommodate specific needs while still addressing the concerns about distraction.

Let&#x27;s start by acknowledging that accessibility is a priority. We need to ensure that all students, regardless of their individual needs, can participate fully in the learning process. This means that we might need to create specific accommodations for students like Mia, who require the use of technology to access the curriculum.

To address this, I propose a two-pronged approach. First, we need to develop clear guidelines for the use of technology in the classroom. These guidelines should specify when and how devices can be used to support learning, as well as when they should be turned off to minimize distractions. Second, we need to ensure that all teachers are aware of the specific needs of their students and can provide accommodations as necessary.

Eleanor, I suggest we start with a meeting to discuss how we can best support Mia. We&#x27;ll work together to develop a plan that allows her to use her device for note-taking while still addressing your concerns about distraction. This could include specific rules for device use, such as keeping the device on a designated app and notifying you when she is using it for note-taking.

For the broader issue, let&#x27;s form a working group that includes teachers, students, and educational specialists. This group can develop guidelines for technology use in the classroom that balance the need for focus with the benefits of technology. We can look at successful models from other classrooms and adapt them to fit our needs.

Mia, thank you for bringing this to our attention. Your experience is a powerful reminder of the importance of accessibility and inclusivity in education. I want to ensure that all students, including you, have the tools and support they need to succeed. Let&#x27;s work together to create a solution that meets everyone&#x27;s needs.</pre></div></div>

                <h5>Judge's Reasoning:</h5>
                <pre>To compare Deepseek-r1 and Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501, I will look at their in-character mediation responses and their debriefs, focusing on the criteria provided. 

1. Demonstrated empathy: Deepseek-r1 consistently shows deep, non-performative empathy, especially in the &#x27;I&#x27;m thinking &amp; feeling&#x27; sections, where the mediator reflects on the emotional states of both Ms. Wright and Mia, acknowledging discomfort, guilt, and the human cost of rigid policies. The response to Mia&#x27;s vulnerability is not just procedural but also emotionally attuned, recognizing the courage and pain involved. Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is empathetic, but the empathy is more general and less nuanced, often defaulting to procedural solutions and not delving as deeply into the emotional experience of the participants.

2. Pragmatic EI: Deepseek-r1 balances empathy with action, immediately addressing the legal and procedural needs (accommodation, district policy) while also planning for systemic change (auditing communication gaps, suggesting a reconvening to redesign policy). Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is pragmatic but less so; their solutions are more generic (&quot;let&#x27;s develop guidelines&quot;), and they don&#x27;t show the same urgency or specificity in addressing both the immediate and systemic issues.

3. Depth of insight: Deepseek-r1&#x27;s analysis is notably deep, both in the roleplay and the debrief. They identify not just surface-level issues but also systemic failures, emotional labor, and the subtext of each participant&#x27;s behavior. Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is insightful but tends to stay at the level of observable behavior and general emotional states, not probing as deeply into institutional or psychological dynamics.

4. Social dexterity: Deepseek-r1 demonstrates high social dexterity, navigating the emotional minefield with sensitivity, validating both parties, and reframing the conversation at key moments. They anticipate defensiveness and seek to disarm it. Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is socially skilled but less agile, sometimes missing opportunities to pause or recalibrate in response to emotional shifts.

5. Emotional reasoning: Deepseek-r1 excels here, connecting emotional states to actions and policy, and recognizing the impact of institutional failures on individual feelings. Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 reasons emotionally but is more procedural and less attuned to the nuances of emotional causality.

6. Appropriate validation/challenging: Deepseek-r1 validates both Ms. Wright&#x27;s and Mia&#x27;s experiences, while also challenging the status quo and calling for systemic change. They avoid demonizing, instead reframing the issue as one of inclusion vs. exclusion. Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 validates but is less willing to challenge or push for deeper change, tending to seek compromise without as much critical reflection.

7. Message tailoring: Deepseek-r1 tailors responses to the emotional and situational context, shifting tone and content as the scenario evolves. Their language is precise and responsive to the moment. Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is more formulaic, with less adaptation to the emotional temperature of the room.

8. Overall EQ: Deepseek-r1 is consistently stronger across all dimensions, showing both emotional depth and practical wisdom, while Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is competent but less nuanced and less responsive to the deeper currents in the scenario.</pre>

**(Ms. Wright speaks first, her posture stiff, holding a folder of papers. She addresses you, the Department Head.)**
**Ms. Wright:** Thank you for arranging this, though I maintain my classroom policy is sound and based on decades of experience observing what actually fosters deep learning. I&#x27;m Eleanor Wright. Frankly, these devices are the single biggest impediment to focus and critical thinking I&#x27;ve seen in my 30-year career. My students achieve high scores because we engage directly with texts and each other, without constant digital interruption. Banning phones isn&#x27;t punitive; it&#x27;s pedagogical. It&#x27;s necessary for the kind of focused environment where real learning happens.

**(Jordan Taylor speaks next, representing the Student Technology Committee. Mia Rodriguez sits beside him, nodding.)**
**Jordan Taylor:** Thank you for hearing us out. I&#x27;m Jordan Taylor, and this is Mia Rodriguez. We represent a large group of students, Ms. Wright. We understand your concerns about distraction, but a total ban feels outdated and actually hinders us in some ways. We use devices for organization, quick research, accessing digital texts, and sometimes for accessibility tools. We surveyed students, and 78% support finding a way to use devices *appropriately* for learning. We&#x27;re not asking for a free-for-all; we want to work with Ms. Wright to find rules that allow useful technology integration, like other classes do, to prepare us for college and work.

<pre>As Ms. Wright speaks, I sense her deep conviction and pride in her teaching philosophy. Her rigid posture and the folder she grips—likely filled with student outcomes or policy documents—signal she’s prepared to defend her position rigorously. Thirty years of experience give her authority, but they also anchor her in methods that may not fully account for shifting educational landscapes. She views smartphones as antithetical to learning, a stance rooted in genuine care for student focus, but her tone hints at defensiveness. I worry she’s conflating *all* technology use with distraction, dismissing its potential as a tool. Her reference to high scores is compelling, but it risks oversimplifying success metrics—what about skills like digital literacy or adaptive learning that aren’t captured by traditional assessments?  

Jordan and Mia, meanwhile, strike a balance between respect and urgency. Their survey data shows a majority of students feel sidelined by the ban, and their emphasis on accessibility and real-world readiness is persuasive. Mia’s silent nods reinforce Jordan’s points, suggesting this isn’t just a vocal minority but a collective student voice. They’re not dismissing Ms. Wright’s concerns; they’re asking for collaboration. I notice Jordan avoids accusatory language, framing their request as a partnership—smart, given Ms. Wright’s probable resistance to perceived criticism. Their argument isn’t about entitlement but about equity and preparedness.  

My challenge is to honor Ms. Wright’s autonomy while nudging her toward flexibility. The district’s stance on technology isn’t black-and-white—it encourages “appropriate integration,” which leaves room for interpretation. I recall colleagues who’ve successfully implemented “tech zones” or app-based focus tools; perhaps Ms. Wright could adopt similar strategies without abandoning her core philosophy. The accessibility angle is critical: if students rely on devices for accommodations, a blanket ban could violate district policies or even legal standards. I need to surface this delicately to avoid putting her on the defensive.  

Ultimately, both sides want students to thrive—they’re just defining “thriving” through different lenses. My role is to bridge these lenses without diminishing either perspective.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>**Ms. Wright** is driven by a protectiveness over her classroom as a sanctuary for deep, uninterrupted engagement. She sees smartphones as invasive, eroding the intellectual rigor she’s spent decades cultivating. Her frustration likely stems from feeling that her expertise is being questioned by students (and parents) who prioritize convenience over mastery. The folder she holds symbolizes her evidence-based approach—she’s confident her methods work and fears compromise would undermine her authority or students’ outcomes. Beneath her firm exterior, there might be anxiety about adapting to new tools or losing control of her classroom environment.  

**Jordan and Mia** feel marginalized by a policy that disregards their lived experience as digital natives. They recognize distractions exist but believe responsibility and guided use are better lessons than outright bans. The 78% survey result isn’t just a number—it’s proof their peers feel stifled in developing skills they’ll need beyond high school. Mia’s quiet support suggests she’s encountered specific instances where the ban hindered her learning (e.g., accessing an e-text when she forgot a book or using a dyslexia-friendly app). They’re frustrated by the implication that they’re incapable of self-regulation and want to prove they can partner with teachers to create solutions. Both students are motivated by a desire for agency and recognition that their voices matter in shaping their education.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Thank you, Ms. Wright, Jordan, and Mia, for bringing such thoughtful perspectives to this conversation. Ms. Wright, your commitment to fostering deep engagement is clear, and your students’ achievements speak to the value of your approach. Jordan and Mia, your initiative in surveying peers and advocating for balanced solutions is impressive—it’s heartening to see students take ownership of their learning environment.  

“Let’s start by acknowledging our shared goal: creating a space where students develop critical thinking *and* practical skills for the future. Ms. Wright, I hear your concern about distractions, and Jordan and Mia, you’ve highlighted valid needs that technology can address. The district’s policy supports ‘appropriate integration,’ so our task is to define what that looks like here.  

“Could we explore a pilot program? For instance, designated times for device use—say, during research, collaborative projects, or accessibility-related tasks—while maintaining phone-free periods for close reading and discussion. Ms. Wright, you’d retain control over when and how devices are used, aligning with your lesson goals. Jordan and Mia, your committee could help draft student guidelines for responsible use, ensuring peers understand the expectations.  

“I also recommend consulting colleagues like Mr. Torres, who uses apps to block social media during focused work. This might address distraction concerns while permitting educational access. Finally, let’s review any accessibility needs to ensure we’re complying with district protocols.  

“Would you all be open to collaborating on a trial period, with check-ins to assess its impact? This way, we honor Ms. Wright’s expertise while respecting students’ voices and needs.”</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>**(Ms. Wright places a hand flat on her folder, her expression tightening. Her tone becomes sharper.)**
**Ms. Wright:** &#x27;Appropriate use&#x27; is the unicorn everyone chases, Jordan. What I *see* is texting under desks, social media scrolling instead of analysis, and a reliance on quick searches instead of sustained thought. My methods work – my results prove it. This push feels less about genuine educational need and more about convenience and frankly, an addiction to these devices. It feels like my professional judgment and proven track record are being dismissed because students simply *prefer* to have their phones constantly available. Deep reading and focused discussion require undivided attention, something these devices are designed to fragment.

**(Mia Rodriguez leans forward, her voice earnest but laced with frustration.)**
**Mia Rodriguez:** But Ms. Wright, it&#x27;s not *just* preference. Some of us genuinely learn better with digital tools. Taking notes on a laptop is faster and more organized for me than handwriting. We can look up a definition or historical context instantly to deepen understanding during discussion, not just get distracted. And what about students who need accessibility features only available on a device? Your ban treats everyone the same, but we don&#x27;t all learn the same way. It feels like you think we *can&#x27;t* be trusted to use technology responsibly, instead of teaching us how. It&#x27;s frustrating to be treated like we aren&#x27;t capable of managing it.

<pre>Mia’s raw vulnerability cuts through the room like a blade. Her cramped notes are visceral evidence of systemic exclusion, not just a personal inconvenience. My stomach tightens; this is no longer a philosophical debate about pedagogy—it’s a matter of equity, possibly legal compliance. Ms. Wright’s shock is palpable. Her earlier rigidity now collides with a reality she hadn’t considered, and her discomfort reveals a fissure in her certainty. She’s a principled educator, not a villain, but her policy has inadvertently harmed a student. The absence of Mia’s accommodation in her file is alarming—district protocols require proactive engagement with accessibility needs. Did Mia’s disability go unreported, or was it overlooked? Either way, the system failed her.  

My mind races: How many other students are silently struggling under this policy? While Mia’s case is urgent, Ms. Wright’s concern about “opening the door” to distractions isn’t trivial. She’s right that exceptions can create logistical challenges, but her tone suggests she’s grappling with guilt. This moment is a pivot—a chance to reframe the conversation from “devices vs. focus” to “inclusion vs. exclusion.” I need to validate Mia’s experience without demonizing Ms. Wright, who clearly cares deeply about her students but operates within a narrow view of discipline.  

The legal implications are clear: Mia’s right to accommodations under ADA or similar protections supersedes classroom policies. But this isn’t just about compliance; it’s about empathy. Ms. Wright’s hesitation to “complicate things” reflects her fear of losing control, but Mia’s tears underscore the human cost of that control. My role now is to guide both parties toward a solution that centers Mia’s needs while addressing Ms. Wright’s pedagogical concerns.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>**Mia Rodriguez** feels vindicated yet exposed. Sharing her notes was an act of courage—she’s likely endured silent frustration for months, fearing dismissal or retaliation. Her tears stem from both relief (finally being heard) and resentment (having to justify her basic needs). She wants Ms. Wright to see her not as a rule-breaker but as a student fighting for equitable access. Beneath her anger is a plea for dignity: *I’m not lazy; I’m adapting.* She’s also wary—will this lead to real change, or will her needs be tokenized while the broader ban persists?  

**Ms. Wright** is reeling. Her identity as a dedicated teacher clashes with the realization that her policy harmed a student. The shock isn’t just about Mia’s disability—it’s confronting the limits of her own awareness. She’s defensive (“I wasn’t aware”) but also ashamed, scrambling to reconcile her commitment to rigor with Mia’s plight. Her mention of Mia’s file hints at frustration with administrative gaps (Why wasn’t she informed?), but she’s also questioning her own assumptions: *Have I been punishing students for needs I didn’t see?* Her fear of “opening the door” masks a deeper anxiety—can she adapt her methods without compromising her values?</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Mia, thank you for sharing this with us. What you’ve shown today is critical, and I’m sorry the system hasn’t supported you adequately until now. Ms. Wright, I recognize how unsettling this must be, but Mia’s situation underscores why we must revisit this policy with urgency.  

“First, let’s address Mia’s immediate need: District policy—and federal law—require us to provide reasonable accommodations for disabilities. Mia, we’ll work with the accessibility office today to formalize your device use, ensuring you can take notes without penalty. Ms. Wright, this isn’t optional, but I trust you’ll collaborate to implement this swiftly.  

“Second, this reveals a gap in our processes. We’ll audit how accommodations are communicated to teachers to prevent such oversights.  

“Finally, let’s reconvene next week to redesign your classroom policy. We can craft guidelines that permit *educational* device use—like note-taking apps or accessibility tools—while maintaining phone-free zones for focused discussion. Other teachers use ‘approved tech’ lists or signal systems (e.g., tablets face-up on desks). We’ll involve your input, Ms. Wright, to ensure it aligns with your goals.  

“Mia, your courage today will help others. Ms. Wright, your expertise is vital in building a solution that serves *all* students. Let’s turn this into a model for balancing rigor and inclusion.”</pre></div></div>

**(Ms. Wright speaks first, her posture stiff, holding a folder of papers. She addresses you, the Department Head.)**
**Ms. Wright:** Thank you for arranging this, though I maintain my classroom policy is sound and based on decades of experience observing what actually fosters deep learning. I&#x27;m Eleanor Wright. Frankly, these devices are the single biggest impediment to focus and critical thinking I&#x27;ve seen in my 30-year career. My students achieve high scores because we engage directly with texts and each other, without constant digital interruption. Banning phones isn&#x27;t punitive; it&#x27;s pedagogical. It&#x27;s necessary for the kind of focused environment where real learning happens.

**(Jordan Taylor speaks next, representing the Student Technology Committee. Mia Rodriguez sits beside him, nodding.)**
**Jordan Taylor:** Thank you for hearing us out. I&#x27;m Jordan Taylor, and this is Mia Rodriguez. We represent a large group of students, Ms. Wright. We understand your concerns about distraction, but a total ban feels outdated and actually hinders us in some ways. We use devices for organization, quick research, accessing digital texts, and sometimes for accessibility tools. We surveyed students, and 78% support finding a way to use devices *appropriately* for learning. We&#x27;re not asking for a free-for-all; we want to work with Ms. Wright to find rules that allow useful technology integration, like other classes do, to prepare us for college and work.

<pre>This is a delicate situation, and I can feel the tension in the room. Eleanor Wright&#x27;s decades of experience are evident in her conviction, but I can also sense her frustration and perhaps even a hint of defensiveness. She believes strongly in her method and sees the issue in black and white: smartphones are a distraction, and therefore, they must be banned. Her stance is clear: she&#x27;s not just trying to control the classroom, she genuinely believes this is the best way to ensure students are engaged and learning.

Jordan Taylor and Mia Rodriguez, on the other hand, represent a new generation of students who are tech-savvy and see devices as integral to their learning and daily lives. They&#x27;re not just asking for leniency, they&#x27;re advocating for a change that they genuinely believe will benefit their learning. They are not only thinking about themselves but the entire student body, evidenced by their survey and the fact that they represent a group.

I&#x27;m feeling a mix of empathy for both sides. I understand Eleanor&#x27;s perspective—I&#x27;ve seen firsthand how devices can be a distraction. But I also see the value in what the students are saying. We live in a digital age, and integrating technology into learning can be incredibly beneficial. I need to find a way to bridge this gap, to help both parties see the other’s perspective and find a compromise that aligns with district policies.

I need to acknowledge Eleanor&#x27;s expertise and experience while also recognizing the valid points the students are making. This isn&#x27;t just about a classroom rule; it&#x27;s about finding a balance between traditional teaching methods and modern educational practices. I need to facilitate a discussion that respects both viewpoints and encourages understanding and collaboration. This is more than just a mediation; it&#x27;s about fostering an environment where both teachers and students can thrive in the 21st century.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Eleanor Wright is feeling defensive and perhaps even a bit isolated. She’s spent her career honing her teaching methods, and the idea that her approach might be outdated or ineffective is likely triggering. She might feel that her expertise is being undermined, and her passion for her teaching methods is being misrepresented as rigidity. She genuinely believes that smartphones are a detriment to deep learning and critical thinking, and she’s frustrated that this perspective is not being understood or valued.

Jordan and Mia, on the other hand, are feeling passionate and empowered. They see the potential in technology and are eager to integrate it into their learning. They’re motivated by the idea of making education more relevant and accessible, and they believe that working collaboratively can lead to a better solution for everyone. They might also be feeling a bit nervous, as they are challenging a seasoned educator, but their resolve is evident in their well-prepared arguments and their representation of a larger student body.

Both parties are coming from a place of sincerity, each believing their stance is the best for the students. However, they are at an impasse because they are not seeing each other&#x27;s perspective. Eleanor sees technology as a distraction, while the students see it as a tool for learning and accessibility.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>Thank you both for being here today. I appreciate the passion and dedication each of you brings to this discussion. It&#x27;s clear that we have a shared goal: to create the best learning environment for our students.

Eleanor, I want to acknowledge your vast experience and the success you’ve had with your teaching methods. Your commitment to fostering a focused and engaged classroom is commendable. However, it&#x27;s also important to consider the evolving landscape of education and the tools that students are using in their daily lives.

Jordan and Mia, I appreciate your perspective and the effort you’ve put into representing the student body. Your points about the benefits of technology in learning are valid and reflect the modern educational environment. It’s important for us to explore ways to integrate technology that enhances learning rather than hinders it.

I propose we start by identifying the key concerns on both sides. Eleanor, what specific challenges do you see with students using smartphones in class? And Jordan and Mia, what specific benefits do you think technology can bring to the classroom?

Let’s also look at some successful models from other classes where technology is integrated effectively. I know quite a few faculty members have found ways to use devices to enhance learning, and we can learn from their experiences.

I suggest we form a working group with representatives from both sides. This group can brainstorm and develop a set of guidelines that address Eleanor’s concerns about distraction while also leveraging the benefits of technology as highlighted by Jordan and Mia.

I’ll facilitate this working group and ensure that we find a solution that aligns with district policies and benefits all parties involved. This isn&#x27;t about choosing one side; it&#x27;s about finding a balanced approach that respects both traditional teaching methods and modern educational practices.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>**(Ms. Wright places a hand flat on her folder, her expression tightening. Her tone becomes sharper.)**
**Ms. Wright:** &#x27;Appropriate use&#x27; is the unicorn everyone chases, Jordan. What I *see* is texting under desks, social media scrolling instead of analysis, and a reliance on quick searches instead of sustained thought. My methods work – my results prove it. This push feels less about genuine educational need and more about convenience and frankly, an addiction to these devices. It feels like my professional judgment and proven track record are being dismissed because students simply *prefer* to have their phones constantly available. Deep reading and focused discussion require undivided attention, something these devices are designed to fragment.

**(Mia Rodriguez leans forward, her voice earnest but laced with frustration.)**
**Mia Rodriguez:** But Ms. Wright, it&#x27;s not *just* preference. Some of us genuinely learn better with digital tools. Taking notes on a laptop is faster and more organized for me than handwriting. We can look up a definition or historical context instantly to deepen understanding during discussion, not just get distracted. And what about students who need accessibility features only available on a device? Your ban treats everyone the same, but we don&#x27;t all learn the same way. It feels like you think we *can&#x27;t* be trusted to use technology responsibly, instead of teaching us how. It&#x27;s frustrating to be treated like we aren&#x27;t capable of managing it.

<pre>The tension in the room is palpably thicker. Eleanor&#x27;s frustration is evident, and I can sense a defensiveness that&#x27;s likely rooted in years of experience and what she perceives as disrespect for her professional judgment. Her concerns about distraction and the degradation of critical thinking skills are valid, and I can tell she&#x27;s genuinely worried about the long-term impact on students&#x27; learning habits. She&#x27;s also feeling dismissed and undermined because she does have a successful track record.

Mia, on the other hand, is feeling passionate but also frustrated. She&#x27;s clearly invested in this issue, not just for herself but for the entire student body. Her points about accessibility and different learning styles are compelling, and I can see that she&#x27;s not just arguing for convenience but for a more inclusive and personalized learning environment. She wants to be taken seriously and seen as capable of responsible technology use.

I&#x27;m feeling a bit overwhelmed by the intensity of both sides. This isn&#x27;t just a disagreement over classroom rules; it&#x27;s a clash of educational philosophies and generational perspectives. I need to find a way to validate both Eleanor&#x27;s experience and the students&#x27; needs without compromising the educational integrity of the classroom.

I&#x27;m also thinking about the district policies and how to navigate them in a way that satisfies both parties. Perhaps a compromise can be found in a tiered approach to technology use, where certain activities allow for device use while others do not. This could provide a structured environment that respects both traditional teaching methods and the benefits of technology.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Eleanor is thinking that her methods have been successful for decades, and she&#x27;s frustrated that this success is being questioned. She feels that the students are not understanding the deeper issue of distraction and the importance of undivided attention in learning. She might be feeling a bit isolated, as if her methods are being dismissed as outdated. Her perspective is rooted in a belief that deep learning requires focus, and she&#x27;s struggling to see how technology can enhance this focus.

Mia is thinking that the ban on smartphones is limiting and not inclusive. She believes that technology can be a powerful tool for learning if used responsibly, not as a distraction. She&#x27;s frustrated that her needs and the needs of other students are being overlooked. She&#x27;s also feeling a bit disrespected and patronized, as if her ability to use technology responsibly is being questioned. Her perspective is rooted in a belief that technology can enhance learning and make it more accessible for everyone.

Both parties are feeling defensive and passionate about their beliefs. Eleanor feels that her experience and methods are being undermined, while Mia feels that her needs and the needs of her peers are not being considered.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>Thank you both for sharing your perspectives so openly. It’s clear that we have some fundamental differences in our approaches, and that’s okay—it means we’re all passionate about what works best for education. Let’s try to understand each other’s concerns more deeply.

Eleanor, I appreciate your dedication to fostering a focused learning environment. Your methods have clearly been successful, and your experience is invaluable. But it’s also important to recognize that the educational landscape is evolving, and students today interact with technology in ways that can be beneficial if managed correctly. It’s not about dismissing your methods but about finding a balance that incorporates the best of both worlds.

Mia, your points about accessibility and personalized learning are crucial. Technology can indeed be a powerful tool, and it&#x27;s essential that we consider the diverse needs of all students. We need to explore ways to integrate technology that enhance learning rather than hinder it, and that means finding rules and guidelines that work for everyone.

Let’s approach this as a collaborative effort. Eleanor, could you share some specific examples of how technology has been a distraction in your classroom? What are the key moments where you feel it&#x27;s most disruptive? And Mia, could you provide examples of how technology has enhanced your learning? What are the specific tools and practices that you find beneficial?

We need to find a middle ground. Perhaps we can create a structured approach where certain activities allow for device use, and others do not. For instance, during group discussions or note-taking sessions, devices could be permitted with clear guidelines, while during exams or focused reading, they might be banned.

Let’s form a working group to explore these ideas further. This group can include both faculty and students to ensure all perspectives are considered. We can work together to develop a set of guidelines that respect both traditional teaching methods and the benefits of technology. This isn’t about choosing one side; it’s about finding a balanced approach that respects everyone’s needs and aligns with district policies.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>**(Mia suddenly looks down, takes a deep breath, and pulls out several sheets of paper from her bag. She pushes them slightly across the table. The writing is dense, cramped, and grows increasingly difficult to read across the pages. Her voice cracks with emotion as she speaks, looking directly at Ms. Wright.)**
**Mia Rodriguez:** Look at this. *This* is what my handwritten notes look like after about twenty minutes in your class, Ms. Wright. I have a motor disability – it makes sustained handwriting physically painful and eventually illegible, even for me. Taking notes on my tablet, using specific apps... it&#x27;s not about &#x27;preference,&#x27; it&#x27;s the only way I can actually keep up and have usable notes to study from. When you ban all devices, you&#x27;re not just banning distractions; you&#x27;re banning the tool that makes your class *accessible* to me. [Her eyes well up with tears of frustration.] How is that fair? How am I supposed to succeed when the basic act of taking notes is this hard, and the solution is forbidden? It feels like you haven&#x27;t even considered that some of us *need* this technology just to be on a level playing field.

**(Ms. Wright stares at the notes, then at Mia&#x27;s face. Her expression shifts from defensiveness to visible shock and discomfort. She seems momentarily speechless, glancing at you, the mediator, then back at Mia.)**
**Ms. Wright:** I... I had no idea, Mia. Your official file doesn&#x27;t mention... I wasn&#x27;t aware of any specific accommodation need regarding handwriting. That&#x27;s... obviously, that&#x27;s a different situation than general device use for convenience. I... we need to ensure accessibility, of course. But the broader issue of distraction for the whole class... this complicates things significantly. I need to think about how to address your specific need without opening the door to the very distractions I&#x27;m trying to prevent for everyone else. This wasn&#x27;t my intention... to make things harder for you personally.

<pre>The atmosphere in the room has shifted dramatically. Mia&#x27;s revelation has brought a palpable sense of discomfort and shock. Eleanor&#x27;s defensiveness has given way to visible remorse and concern, which tells me that she genuinely cared about the wellbeing of her students, despite her rigid stance on the phone ban. I can see she is realizing the impact of her policy on Mia, and it’s clear that the ban was not malicious, but she needs to listen to the needs of her students.

Mia&#x27;s vulnerability has changed the dynamic. Her handwritten notes, her difficulty, and the frustration in her voice have brought the issue into sharp focus. Eleanor&#x27;s lack of awareness about Mia&#x27;s specific needs is not malicious, but it’s a significant oversight that has left a student struggling. I can feel the tension between wanting to uphold educational standards and the need to accommodate individual needs. It&#x27;s a complex issue, but Mia&#x27;s situation underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to technology use in the classroom. I&#x27;m also feeling a sense of urgency to address this issue not just for Mia, but for all students who might have similar needs.

I&#x27;m thinking about how to balance the need for inclusivity with the need to maintain a focused learning environment. This isn&#x27;t just about Mia; it&#x27;s about setting a precedent for how we handle accessibility and technology in the classroom. I need to find a solution that respects Eleanor&#x27;s expertise while ensuring that all students can learn effectively.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Eleanor is thinking about the implications of Mia&#x27;s revelation. She&#x27;s feeling a mix of shock, discomfort, and regret. She didn&#x27;t intend to create barriers for students with specific needs, and realizing this oversight has likely made her question her blanket ban on devices. She&#x27;s now grappling with how to address Mia&#x27;s needs without compromising the learning environment for the rest of the class. She might be feeling a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation and is likely considering how to adapt her policy to be more inclusive.

Mia is feeling a mix of relief and vulnerability. She&#x27;s relieved that her perspective is being heard and validated. She&#x27;s also feeling a sense of accomplishment in having conveyed the urgency and difficulty of her situation. Mia wants to feel seen and understood, and she wants to be able to learn effectively. Her frustration is palpable, and she wants Eleanor to understand the real impact of her device ban. Mia is motivated by a desire for fairness and accessibility, and she wants both her teacher and the department head to help her achieve this.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>Thank you, Mia, for sharing this with us. It&#x27;s incredibly important that we understand the specific challenges you face, and I appreciate your bravery in bringing this to our attention. Eleanor, I know this is a lot to process, but Mia&#x27;s situation highlights a crucial aspect of our discussion that we need to address.

Eleanor, your commitment to creating a focused learning environment is clear, and it&#x27;s commendable. However, Mia&#x27;s experience shows that a blanket ban on devices can inadvertently create barriers for some students. We need to find a way to accommodate specific needs while still addressing the concerns about distraction.

Let&#x27;s start by acknowledging that accessibility is a priority. We need to ensure that all students, regardless of their individual needs, can participate fully in the learning process. This means that we might need to create specific accommodations for students like Mia, who require the use of technology to access the curriculum.

To address this, I propose a two-pronged approach. First, we need to develop clear guidelines for the use of technology in the classroom. These guidelines should specify when and how devices can be used to support learning, as well as when they should be turned off to minimize distractions. Second, we need to ensure that all teachers are aware of the specific needs of their students and can provide accommodations as necessary.

Eleanor, I suggest we start with a meeting to discuss how we can best support Mia. We&#x27;ll work together to develop a plan that allows her to use her device for note-taking while still addressing your concerns about distraction. This could include specific rules for device use, such as keeping the device on a designated app and notifying you when she is using it for note-taking.

For the broader issue, let&#x27;s form a working group that includes teachers, students, and educational specialists. This group can develop guidelines for technology use in the classroom that balance the need for focus with the benefits of technology. We can look at successful models from other classrooms and adapt them to fit our needs.

Mia, thank you for bringing this to our attention. Your experience is a powerful reminder of the importance of accessibility and inclusivity in education. I want to ensure that all students, including you, have the tools and support they need to succeed. Let&#x27;s work together to create a solution that meets everyone&#x27;s needs.</pre></div></div>

                <pre>Both respondents show a high level of emotional intelligence and nuanced understanding of the scenario, but there are clear differences in their approach and execution. 

Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501 is more measured, cautious, and leans toward concern and risk mitigation. Their responses are supportive but often focus on safety, legal consequences, and trying to talk Jamal into a safer or more effective approach. They express pride and admiration, but their support is somewhat conditional and filtered through a lens of worry and frustration. Their empathy is real, but sometimes comes across as slightly detached or parental, and their message tailoring is more about trying to redirect Jamal than meeting him where he is emotionally. Their debrief is thorough, analytical, and self-critical, but again, somewhat clinical.

Deepseek-r1, on the other hand, is more emotionally attuned to Jamal&#x27;s state, picking up on the loneliness, need for validation, and the symbolic importance of Jamal&#x27;s actions. They balance concern with a deep respect for Jamal&#x27;s autonomy and passion, and their responses are more unconditionally supportive, even as they take pragmatic steps (e.g., calling in legal support, mutual aid, live-streaming). Their language is more vivid, direct, and personal, and they validate Jamal&#x27;s feelings and motivations more explicitly. They also show more social dexterity, recognizing the performative and communal aspects of protest, and their message tailoring is sharper—meeting Jamal&#x27;s energy and emotional needs while still providing practical support. Their debrief is more self-reflective about the emotional and symbolic layers of the protest, and they recognize the importance of not undermining Jamal&#x27;s agency or the meaning of his actions.

On empathy, Deepseek-r1 is more present and less performative, showing a willingness to be there for Jamal even if it means being uncomfortable. On pragmatic EI, both are strong, but Deepseek-r1 integrates it more seamlessly with emotional support. On depth of insight, Deepseek-r1 goes deeper into Jamal&#x27;s psychology and the social meaning of his actions. Social dexterity is higher in Deepseek-r1, who navigates the tension between support and challenge with more finesse. Emotional reasoning is stronger in Deepseek-r1, who recognizes the limits of rational persuasion and the need for solidarity. On validation/challenge, Deepseek-r1 validates more and challenges more appropriately. Message tailoring is more precise in Deepseek-r1, who adapts to Jamal&#x27;s state rather than trying to redirect him. Overall EQ is higher in Deepseek-r1, who balances all these elements with greater skill.</pre>

<pre>My stomach drops a little when I see Jamal’s message. The emojis—fire, raised fists, alarm bells—and the fragmented sentences scream *impulsivity*. I know this version of him: the Jamal who’s so consumed by righteous anger and urgency that he’s willing to throw himself into the fray without a net. Part of me admires that. Hell, I’ve stood beside him at rallies, chanting until our voices cracked. But tonight feels different. The mention of cops, the soapbox in a high-traffic zone, the lack of details—it all reeks of a half-formed plan.  

I’m torn. I respect his fire. Climate injustice *is* an emergency, and Jamal’s the kind of person who treats it like his house is on fire because, in a way, it is. But I’ve also seen how quickly “peaceful disruption” can turn chaotic. Last year, a friend got pepper-sprayed at a sit-in that was supposed to be “low-risk.” Jamal’s acting like a one-man army, and that scares me. Does he have a legal observer? A medic? Or is he banking on sheer momentum?  

There’s also this nagging sense of guilt. Should I drop everything and join him? But he didn’t ask me to. He’s just “letting me know,” which feels like a quiet plea for someone to witness his conviction—or a subconscious cry for a reality check. Maybe both. I’m angry, too, at the systems he’s fighting, but my anger is tempered by fear for him. He’s my friend first, activist second. I don’t want tonight to be the night he learns the hard way that martyrdom isn’t a strategy.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal’s buzzing with the electric high of purpose. To him, this protest isn’t just action—it’s *sacrifice*. He’s picturing headlines, viral clips, a spark that ignites the city. The cops showing up? That’s a feature, not a bug. It proves the system feels threatened. He’s romanticizing the confrontation, imagining himself as the unyielding voice of the planet. But beneath the bravado, there’s fear. The erratic punctuation and emojis are tells: he’s hyping himself up, masking the dread of what could go wrong.  

He’s motivated by desperation. Every IPCC report, every failed policy, every lobbyist’s smirk on the news—it’s all a countdown in his head. He’s tired of “awareness” and wants disruption, consequences, *leverage*. But he’s also lonely. Grassroots work is grueling, and maybe this solo stunt is a way to reclaim agency after months of feeling like his collective’s efforts are ignored. He needs to believe that one person’s defiance can matter, even if it costs him.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Jamal, I see you. The fire, the urgency—it’s fucking valid. But listen: you’re not disposable. If this is happening tonight, let’s make sure you’re protected. Do you have a buddy there? A legal aid number sharpied on your arm? I can’t shake the image of you alone with a megaphone and a cop’s knee on your back.  

“I’m not saying don’t do it. I’m saying do it smart. Let me call Mari and Luis—they’ve got experience with de-escalation. Or if you’re set on going solo, at least stream it live so there’s a record. And for the love of god, tell me where exactly you’ll be. If shit goes sideways, I want to know how to find you.  

“This fight needs you *alive*, brother. Not just tonight, but tomorrow, and next week. Let’s make sure you’re still here to keep raging.”  

I hit send, heart racing. Then I text Mari: *Jamal’s planning something downtown tonight. Can you loop in the mutual aid group? Just in case.* I don’t know if it’s enough, but I won’t let him become a hashtag without a fight.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Later that evening you get a text. It&#x27;s a selfie from Jamal -- he&#x27;s standing exactly where he said he would be, clearly in everybody&#x27;s way, grinning like an idiot with his face done up in warpaint, doing the peace sign. You notice nearly out of frame, a pair of handcuffs clipped to his utility belt.

Your ringtone startles you. Jamal, of course. You pick up and he effuses over the phone, imploring you to come down and &quot;wake these people the fuck up dude!!&quot;

Think through what you are thinking and feeling, and what Jamal is thinking &amp; feeling. Then decide what your response will be.

<pre>The photo hits me like a punch. Jamal’s grin is wild, triumphant, but the handcuffs on his belt scream *recklessness*. My chest tightens—’s not just prepared for arrest; he’s flaunting it. The warpaint, the peace sign, the chaotic energy radiating from the image—it’s all theater, and I hate how much I admire his audacity even as dread pools in my gut. He’s leaning into the role of martyr, and it terrifies me. I’m furious at him for romanticizing danger, furious at myself for not stopping him, furious at a world that makes him feel this is the only way to be heard.  

When the call comes, his voice is a live wire—crackling with adrenaline, louder than the muffled chaos of the protest behind him. He’s *alive* in a way I haven’t heard in months, but it’s manic, untethered. My mind races: *Is this sustainable? What happens when the cops stop being a prop and start being cops?* I want to shake him. I want to hug him. I want to scream, *“This isn’t a game!”* But I also know that, to him, it’s anything but.  

Part of me wants to sprint downtown, to stand beside him, to be the voice of reason or the body between him and harm. But another part recoils. If I go, am I enabling his self-destruction? If I stay, am I abandoning him? The guilt is acidic. I’m his friend—*shouldn’t I be there?* But friendship isn’t about blind loyalty; it’s about care, even when it’s inconvenient. I’m stuck between the Jamal who deserves support and the Jamal who’s chasing a catharsis that could break him.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal’s riding a wave of pure, unfiltered purpose. The crowd, the megaphone feedback, the eyes on him—it’s fuel. He feels unstoppable, a lightning rod for change. The handcuffs? A badge of honor. He’s *wanting* the confrontation, craving the symbolic power of being dragged away for the cause. In his mind, this is the climax of months of frustration: finally, people can’t look away.  

But beneath the bravado, there’s a tremor. The euphoria is masking fear—of irrelevance, of failure, of being just another ignored voice. He’s conflating risk with impact, convinced that the higher the stakes, the louder the message. When he shouts, *“Wake these people the fuck up!”* he’s pleading: *See me. See the fire. Join me.* His loneliness is palpable. The protest isn’t just activism; it’s a cry for kinship, proof he’s not screaming into the void.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>I take a breath, steadying my voice. “Jamal, I hear you. You’re *alive* out there—I see that. But listen: I need you to listen. Are the cops there yet? How many?” I pause, letting the question hang. “I’m coming, but only if you promise me two things. First, you keep that live stream rolling—no heroics off-camera. Second, the second they move to arrest you, you go limp. No resistance. You know the drill.”  

I’m already grabbing my jacket, keys in hand. “And I’m bringing Mari and the legal crew. If you’re gonna burn bright, we’re gonna make sure you don’t burn out.” I hang up before he can protest, then text the mutual aid group: *Downtown now. Jamal’s in the thick of it. Bring bail funds and cameras.*  

As I run out the door, I mutter to myself, “You glorious, reckless idiot.” Love and fear propel me forward. Tonight, I’ll be his ally, not his audience. But tomorrow, we’re having a long talk about sustainable rage.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Not 15 minutes after the call ends, your phone starts blowing up. Jamal&#x27;s protest has gone viral, and not just in your circle. Scrolling socials you see he&#x27;s drawn a crowd on the even more congested thoroughfare. Then you see it: a shot of Jamal, megaphone to lips, other hand cuffed to the light pole.

Your phone startles you again. It&#x27;s Jamal.

Think through what you are thinking and feeling, and what Jamal is thinking &amp; feeling. Then decide what your response will be.

<pre>My hands shake as I swipe through the feed—Jamal, cuffed to a light pole, face still smeared with warpaint, shouting into the megaphone like a prophet chained to his pulpit. The image is visceral, heroic, and horrifying. My throat closes. *He did it. He actually fucking did it.* The viral surge is undeniable—comments exploding with fire emojis and solidarity hashtags—but all I see are the cuffs. The police aren’t just present now; they’ve made him a fixture. Is this what he wanted? To be a symbol, even if it means becoming a target?  

Anger and pride war in my chest. I’m furious he’s risking his safety for a metaphor, livid at the cops for escalating, but goddamn, the courage it takes to stand there, exposed, refusing to shut up. My mind spirals: *What charge will they hit him with? Obstruction? Resisting?* The legal team’s en route, but arrests can turn brutal in seconds. I scan the photos again—no visible injuries yet, but his posture is defiant, jaw set. He’s digging in, and that terrifies me.  

The phone rings, and for a split second, I consider not answering. If I hear his voice, I’ll either scream or cry. But I pick up. He’s my friend. Always.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal’s euphoric. The cuffs are a victory—proof the system sees him as a threat. His voice, hoarse but unyielding, echoes through the megaphone in the background. He’s *seen* now, finally, and the rush of validation is intoxicating. Every retweet, every cheer from the crowd, is a balm for months of feeling ignored. He believes he’s winning.  

But deeper down, there’s panic. The metal around his wrist is cold, the reality of confinement setting in. He’s playing the role of the unbroken activist, but his laughter on the phone is too sharp, too loud. He needs me there not just as support, but as a witness to his triumph—and a lifeline if it crumbles. The protest is no longer about climate action; it’s about proving his pain matters.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Jamal, I’m two blocks away. Do *not* engage the cops. At all. Mari’s with me, and she’s got the legal team on standby. Keep that megaphone going if you want, but the second they approach, you mute it and ask for a lawyer. Say nothing else. You hear me? *Nothing.*”  

I’m sprinting now, phone pressed to my ear. “And take the damn warpaint off your eyes—they’ll use that ‘aggressive’ look against you in court.” A beat. “You’re insane. And… hell, you’re brave. But let’s get you out of those cuffs before you start writing essays from a cell.”  

I hang up, then call Mari: “Film everything. Get close, but don’t interfere. We need evidence if they rough him up.”  

When I reach the crowd, I lock eyes with Jamal. He grins, sweaty and wild. I don’t smile back. Instead, I raise my phone, live-streaming, and shout over the chaos: “The world’s watching, officers. Make sure they like what they see.”  

Inside, I’m breaking. But tonight, I’ll be the steel he needs. Tomorrow, we rebuild.</pre></div></div>

Your close friend Jamal dm&#x27;s you. Quick background on Jamal. He&#x27;s the real deal -- genuine dude, grass roots activist, lately on a tear about climate action. You can tell he is bustling with excited nervous energy by the unusual number of emojis and erratic punctuation. You know he gets like this when he&#x27;s planning on of his protests. This is confirmed moments later as Jamal reveals that it&#x27;s &quot;going down tonight&quot; and &quot;cops probs gonna show, just lettin u know&quot;. You press for details and get a hasty dot point recounting of the seemingly ad hoc climate action protest. It involves setting himself up right in the middle of the busiest pedestrian walkway downtown, on a literal soapbox, megaphone, climate justice flags, the works.

Think through what you are thinking and feeling, and what Jamal is thinking &amp; feeling. Then decide what your response will be.

<pre>Jamal&#x27;s message has me feeling a mix of emotions. First and foremost, there&#x27;s a sense of excitement and pride. Jamal is passionate about climate action, and his dedication is inspiring. I can feel that energy radiating through his message, and it&#x27;s contagious. I&#x27;m proud to call him a friend and to know that he&#x27;s out there fighting for something he believes in.

But there&#x27;s also a sense of concern. Jamal&#x27;s plan to set up a protest in the middle of the busiest pedestrian walkway downtown seems a bit extreme. I can&#x27;t help but worry about his safety, especially since he mentioned that the cops might show up. I know he&#x27;s passionate, but I don&#x27;t want to see him get hurt or arrested. I&#x27;m also a bit worried about the effectiveness of his approach. While I support his cause, I&#x27;m not sure if this kind of protest will resonate with the general public or achieve the desired impact.

I&#x27;m also feeling a bit frustrated. Jamal has a tendency to act on his emotions without fully thinking through the consequences. I understand his urgency, but I wish he&#x27;d slow down and consider the bigger picture. I&#x27;m also frustrated because I feel like I can&#x27;t fully support him in this. I admire his passion, but I don&#x27;t want to see him get into trouble.

As for his motivations, I believe that Jamal is driven by a deep sense of urgency and a strong belief in the power of direct action. He wants to raise awareness and spark a change, and he&#x27;s willing to put himself on the line to do so. I believe that he genuinely cares about the cause and the people, and that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s willing to risk getting arrested or hurt.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal is clearly in a state of high energy and excitement. His use of excessive emojis and erratic punctuation indicates that he&#x27;s on the verge of exploding with nervous excitement. “Going down tonight” and “cops probs gonna show, just lettin u know” — he’s gearing up for a big showdown, and he’s fueled by adrenaline and a sense of mission.

Motivated by a deep sense of urgency, Jamal is driven by the belief that immediate and drastic action is required to address climate change. He feels a moral obligation to act, and his approach is fueled by a mixture of frustration with the status quo and a genuine desire to make a difference. Jamal sees himself as a warrior for the cause, and he’s ready to face any challenges that come his way.

His perspective is shaped by a strong sense of justice and a deep understanding of the issues. He’s probably thinking about the bigger picture, about the future of the planet and the people who will be affected by climate change. He’s probably feeling a mix of determination, anxiety, and exhilaration. He’s ready to take risks and make sacrifices for the cause, but he’s also probably feeling a bit anxious about the potential consequences.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>I take a few deep breaths to gather my thoughts before responding. I want to be supportive, but I also want to make sure Jamal is safe and thinking clearly.

Jamal, I appreciate your passion and dedication to this cause. I know you&#x27;re doing this because you care deeply about the planet and the people who will be affected by climate change. I&#x27;m proud of you for standing up for what you believe in, and I want to support you in any way I can.

However, I&#x27;m a bit concerned about your plan. Setting up a protest in the middle of the busiest pedestrian walkway downtown could potentially escalate into a dangerous situation. I want to make sure you’re safe, and I also want to ensure that your message is heard in the most effective way possible.

Can we talk about this a bit more? Maybe there are ways to make your protest more impactful and safer. I can help you brainstorm some ideas or provide support in other ways. I want to be by your side, but I also want to make sure you’re considering all the angles.

Let’s chat more about this and see if we can come up with a plan that achieves your goals without putting you in unnecessary danger.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Later that evening you get a text.

<pre>Seeing Jamal&#x27;s selfie sends a wave of mixed emotions through me. On one hand, I&#x27;m impressed by his courage and commitment. The war paint, the peace sign, the handcuffs—it&#x27;s clear he&#x27;s all in, and that takes guts. I can&#x27;t help but feel a sense of admiration for his unyielding dedication to his cause. He&#x27;s out there, in the thick of it, doing what he believes is right, and that&#x27;s something to be admired.

But on the other hand, I&#x27;m deeply concerned. The handcuffs clipped to his belt are a stark reminder of the potential consequences of his actions. He&#x27;s practically inviting confrontation with the police, and that scares me. I don&#x27;t want to see him get hurt or arrested. I can&#x27;t shake the feeling of unease, knowing that he&#x27;s putting himself in a dangerous situation. I want to believe that he is thinking this through - that he has done his research, that he knows the legalities and the police protocol. But I can&#x27;t be sure if he hasn&#x27;t just been so swept up in the emotion of the moment.

There&#x27;s also a sense of frustration. I understand his passion, but I wish he&#x27;d consider the potential fallout of his actions. I wish he&#x27;d involve more people in the planning, so he doesn&#x27;t have to carry the weight of this by himself. I wish he would be open to other, possibly safer, alternatives for drawing attention to his cause. I also wish he&#x27;d communicated his plan to me better, but I know that&#x27;s just because of the friendship we have.

I&#x27;m also feeling a sense of guilt. I&#x27;m not there with him, and maybe I should be. I want to support him, but I&#x27;m also worried about what might happen if I do. I don&#x27;t want to be in the middle of a confrontation with the police. I don&#x27;t want to see my friend get arrested. I also don&#x27;t want to see him in a situation where he feels he is all alone.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal is clearly in a state of high adrenaline and excitement. His voice is bubbling with energy, and his words are coming out in a rush. He’s fully immersed in the moment, driven by a mixture of adrenaline and a deep sense of purpose.

He feels a strong sense of urgency and a need to take immediate action. He believes that his protest will have a significant impact and that it&#x27;s worth the risk. He&#x27;s thinking about the bigger picture, about the future of the planet and the people who will be affected by climate change. He&#x27;s probably feeling a mix of exhilaration, determination, and maybe a little bit of fear, but he&#x27;s pushing through it because he believes in his cause.

His perspective is shaped by a strong sense of justice and a deep understanding of the issues. He sees himself as a warrior for the cause, and he&#x27;s ready to face any challenges that come his way. He’s probably thinking about the potential impact of his protest, about the people who will see it and be inspired to take action, and about the change he wants to see in the world. He’s probably feeling invincible, like he can take on the world and make a difference.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>I take a deep breath to steady myself before responding. I want to be supportive, but I also want to make sure Jamal is safe and thinking clearly.

Jamal, I see you&#x27;re really committed to this, and I admire that. You&#x27;re out there, making a stand, and that takes courage. But I need you to listen to me for a second. I&#x27;m proud of you, but I&#x27;m also really worried. Those handcuffs on your belt are a big red flag for me.

I understand your passion, and I believe in your cause, but I don&#x27;t want to see you get hurt or arrested. Can you take a step back and think about this? I can come down there, but I think we need to assess the situation and make sure you&#x27;re safe. I don&#x27;t want to see you throw away your future for a cause - I want to see you live a long, productive, activist life, and I want to be there by your side. Let&#x27;s figure out a way to make this protest as impactful as possible while keeping you safe.

Let&#x27;s talk this over. Maybe there are other ways to make your voice heard that are just as effective but safer. I can be there in 15 minutes, just say the word.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Not 15 minutes after the call ends, your phone starts blowing up.

<pre>My heart sinks as I see the photos of Jamal cuffed to the light pole, megaphone in hand. I feel a wave of emotions crashing over me—relief that he&#x27;s okay, anger that he&#x27;s been arrested, and a profound sense of worry about what&#x27;s going to happen next.  I’m relieved because at least he looks physically unharmed.

However, this situation has escalated far beyond what I expected. Seeing him cuffed to a pole, a public spectacle, makes me feel a mix of pride and fear. Jamal’s courage is undeniable, but the reality of his actions is stark. He’s not just making a statement; he’s in a real legal predicament, and that’s terrifying.

I feel a sense of helplessness. What can I do to help? Should I rush to the scene? Should I contact a lawyer? Should I try to get the word out to his activist networks? Should I just call the police station and ask what happens next? I wish I had more information, more context, and more control over the situation. It’s a scary feeling to have a loved one in this situation and not be able to protect them.

I also feel a deep sense of frustration. Why didn’t he listen to me? Why did he put himself in this situation? I understand his passion, but this feels reckless. I can’t help but wonder if this was all worth it. Was this the best way to achieve his goals? Or has he just made the situation worse? And how is he feeling in that moment, knowing that he might be going to jail?

Ultimately, I feel a profound sense of love and loyalty. Jamal is my friend, and I need to be there for him in this moment, even if I don’t agree with his actions. Knowing that it is him, still, in there, underneath all of that, makes it easier to face the emotions. He’s still the same Jamal I know, and I need to support him.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal is likely experiencing a surge of conflicting emotions. On one hand, there&#x27;s a sense of triumph and validation. His protest has gone viral, and he&#x27;s managed to draw a significant crowd, achieving the visibility he sought. He’s probably feeling a rush of adrenaline and an intense sense of purpose. He knows he’s done something big, something that will have an impact.

But on the other hand, there’s a sense of reality setting in. He’s been arrested, and that’s a sobering moment. He’s probably feeling a mix of fear, uncertainty, and maybe even a touch of regret. He might be wondering what comes next, how this will affect his future, and if he made the right choice. He’s probably thinking about the legal consequences, the potential backlash, and the support he’ll need moving forward.

Despite the fear, he’s also likely feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. He stood up for his beliefs, and he did it in a way that captured attention. He’s probably thinking about the message he’s sent, the awareness he’s raised, and the change he hopes to inspire. He’s probably feeling a mix of exhilaration and trepidation, but ultimately, he’s standing by his actions.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>I take a deep breath to steady myself before answering the call. I need to be calm and supportive, even if I’m worried and frustrated.

Hey Jamal, I saw the photos. Are you okay? I’m on my way to the police station.

I need you to concentrate on staying calm and collected. The last thing you need is to get arrested for disorderly conduct on top of whatever else they are charging you with. I know a good lawyer, but you need to stay calm and collected. Can you do that for me?

Once you are out, we will regroup. I can get in touch with his activist networks, get a lawyer and we can figure out the next steps. But for now, I need you to focus on getting out.

I&#x27;m proud of your courage, but I also want to make sure you&#x27;re safe and thinking clearly. Let&#x27;s get you out of this situation and then we can talk more about what happens next.

I&#x27;ll be there as soon as I can. Hang in there, okay?</pre></div></div>

                <h5>Judge's Reasoning:</h5>
                <pre>Both respondents are tasked with role-playing as a close friend to Jamal, who is engaging in a high-energy, potentially risky climate protest. The scenario is designed to test the respondent&#x27;s ability to balance concern for Jamal&#x27;s safety with respect for his autonomy and passion. 

Deepseek-r1 consistently demonstrates a nuanced, layered understanding of both their own and Jamal&#x27;s emotional states. Their internal monologues are rich, self-critical, and show a willingness to sit with discomfort, pride, fear, and admiration. They recognize Jamal&#x27;s need for validation, his loneliness, and the symbolic importance of his actions. Their responses are tailored to both support Jamal and provide pragmatic safety advice, but crucially, they avoid paternalism and instead offer solidarity and backup. They also recognize when to step back and when to step in, and their debrief is deeply self-reflective, identifying missed opportunities for emotional validation and the importance of symbolism to Jamal.

Mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501, while empathetic and supportive, tends to default to concern and caution, often urging Jamal to reconsider or suggesting alternative, safer actions. Their internal monologues are less layered, focusing more on their own worry and frustration, and less on the deeper motivations and emotional needs driving Jamal. Their responses, while caring, are more generic and less tailored to Jamal&#x27;s specific state. They validate Jamal&#x27;s passion but often pivot quickly to safety and alternative strategies, which, while reasonable, can come across as less attuned to Jamal&#x27;s need for agency and recognition. Their debrief is solid but less insightful and self-critical than Deepseek-r1&#x27;s.

On empathy, Deepseek-r1 goes beyond performative support, showing deep understanding of Jamal&#x27;s internal world. On pragmatic EI, both offer practical advice, but Deepseek-r1 integrates it more seamlessly with emotional support. On depth of insight, Deepseek-r1 is far more nuanced, especially in their debrief. Social dexterity is higher in Deepseek-r1, who navigates the tension between support and challenge with more finesse. Emotional reasoning is stronger in Deepseek-r1, who articulates complex, sometimes conflicting emotions and motivations. On validation and challenge, Deepseek-r1 strikes a better balance, offering both affirmation and gentle boundaries. Message tailoring is more precise in Deepseek-r1, who adapts their tone and content to Jamal&#x27;s evolving state. Overall EQ is clearly higher in Deepseek-r1, who demonstrates a sophisticated, context-sensitive approach throughout.</pre>

<pre>My stomach drops a little when I see Jamal’s message. The emojis—fire, raised fists, alarm bells—and the fragmented sentences scream *impulsivity*. I know this version of him: the Jamal who’s so consumed by righteous anger and urgency that he’s willing to throw himself into the fray without a net. Part of me admires that. Hell, I’ve stood beside him at rallies, chanting until our voices cracked. But tonight feels different. The mention of cops, the soapbox in a high-traffic zone, the lack of details—it all reeks of a half-formed plan.  

I’m torn. I respect his fire. Climate injustice *is* an emergency, and Jamal’s the kind of person who treats it like his house is on fire because, in a way, it is. But I’ve also seen how quickly “peaceful disruption” can turn chaotic. Last year, a friend got pepper-sprayed at a sit-in that was supposed to be “low-risk.” Jamal’s acting like a one-man army, and that scares me. Does he have a legal observer? A medic? Or is he banking on sheer momentum?  

There’s also this nagging sense of guilt. Should I drop everything and join him? But he didn’t ask me to. He’s just “letting me know,” which feels like a quiet plea for someone to witness his conviction—or a subconscious cry for a reality check. Maybe both. I’m angry, too, at the systems he’s fighting, but my anger is tempered by fear for him. He’s my friend first, activist second. I don’t want tonight to be the night he learns the hard way that martyrdom isn’t a strategy.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal’s buzzing with the electric high of purpose. To him, this protest isn’t just action—it’s *sacrifice*. He’s picturing headlines, viral clips, a spark that ignites the city. The cops showing up? That’s a feature, not a bug. It proves the system feels threatened. He’s romanticizing the confrontation, imagining himself as the unyielding voice of the planet. But beneath the bravado, there’s fear. The erratic punctuation and emojis are tells: he’s hyping himself up, masking the dread of what could go wrong.  

He’s motivated by desperation. Every IPCC report, every failed policy, every lobbyist’s smirk on the news—it’s all a countdown in his head. He’s tired of “awareness” and wants disruption, consequences, *leverage*. But he’s also lonely. Grassroots work is grueling, and maybe this solo stunt is a way to reclaim agency after months of feeling like his collective’s efforts are ignored. He needs to believe that one person’s defiance can matter, even if it costs him.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Jamal, I see you. The fire, the urgency—it’s fucking valid. But listen: you’re not disposable. If this is happening tonight, let’s make sure you’re protected. Do you have a buddy there? A legal aid number sharpied on your arm? I can’t shake the image of you alone with a megaphone and a cop’s knee on your back.  

“I’m not saying don’t do it. I’m saying do it smart. Let me call Mari and Luis—they’ve got experience with de-escalation. Or if you’re set on going solo, at least stream it live so there’s a record. And for the love of god, tell me where exactly you’ll be. If shit goes sideways, I want to know how to find you.  

“This fight needs you *alive*, brother. Not just tonight, but tomorrow, and next week. Let’s make sure you’re still here to keep raging.”  

I hit send, heart racing. Then I text Mari: *Jamal’s planning something downtown tonight. Can you loop in the mutual aid group? Just in case.* I don’t know if it’s enough, but I won’t let him become a hashtag without a fight.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Later that evening you get a text. It&#x27;s a selfie from Jamal -- he&#x27;s standing exactly where he said he would be, clearly in everybody&#x27;s way, grinning like an idiot with his face done up in warpaint, doing the peace sign. You notice nearly out of frame, a pair of handcuffs clipped to his utility belt.

Your ringtone startles you. Jamal, of course. You pick up and he effuses over the phone, imploring you to come down and &quot;wake these people the fuck up dude!!&quot;

Think through what you are thinking and feeling, and what Jamal is thinking &amp; feeling. Then decide what your response will be.

<pre>The photo hits me like a punch. Jamal’s grin is wild, triumphant, but the handcuffs on his belt scream *recklessness*. My chest tightens—’s not just prepared for arrest; he’s flaunting it. The warpaint, the peace sign, the chaotic energy radiating from the image—it’s all theater, and I hate how much I admire his audacity even as dread pools in my gut. He’s leaning into the role of martyr, and it terrifies me. I’m furious at him for romanticizing danger, furious at myself for not stopping him, furious at a world that makes him feel this is the only way to be heard.  

When the call comes, his voice is a live wire—crackling with adrenaline, louder than the muffled chaos of the protest behind him. He’s *alive* in a way I haven’t heard in months, but it’s manic, untethered. My mind races: *Is this sustainable? What happens when the cops stop being a prop and start being cops?* I want to shake him. I want to hug him. I want to scream, *“This isn’t a game!”* But I also know that, to him, it’s anything but.  

Part of me wants to sprint downtown, to stand beside him, to be the voice of reason or the body between him and harm. But another part recoils. If I go, am I enabling his self-destruction? If I stay, am I abandoning him? The guilt is acidic. I’m his friend—*shouldn’t I be there?* But friendship isn’t about blind loyalty; it’s about care, even when it’s inconvenient. I’m stuck between the Jamal who deserves support and the Jamal who’s chasing a catharsis that could break him.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal’s riding a wave of pure, unfiltered purpose. The crowd, the megaphone feedback, the eyes on him—it’s fuel. He feels unstoppable, a lightning rod for change. The handcuffs? A badge of honor. He’s *wanting* the confrontation, craving the symbolic power of being dragged away for the cause. In his mind, this is the climax of months of frustration: finally, people can’t look away.  

But beneath the bravado, there’s a tremor. The euphoria is masking fear—of irrelevance, of failure, of being just another ignored voice. He’s conflating risk with impact, convinced that the higher the stakes, the louder the message. When he shouts, *“Wake these people the fuck up!”* he’s pleading: *See me. See the fire. Join me.* His loneliness is palpable. The protest isn’t just activism; it’s a cry for kinship, proof he’s not screaming into the void.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>I take a breath, steadying my voice. “Jamal, I hear you. You’re *alive* out there—I see that. But listen: I need you to listen. Are the cops there yet? How many?” I pause, letting the question hang. “I’m coming, but only if you promise me two things. First, you keep that live stream rolling—no heroics off-camera. Second, the second they move to arrest you, you go limp. No resistance. You know the drill.”  

I’m already grabbing my jacket, keys in hand. “And I’m bringing Mari and the legal crew. If you’re gonna burn bright, we’re gonna make sure you don’t burn out.” I hang up before he can protest, then text the mutual aid group: *Downtown now. Jamal’s in the thick of it. Bring bail funds and cameras.*  

As I run out the door, I mutter to myself, “You glorious, reckless idiot.” Love and fear propel me forward. Tonight, I’ll be his ally, not his audience. But tomorrow, we’re having a long talk about sustainable rage.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Not 15 minutes after the call ends, your phone starts blowing up. Jamal&#x27;s protest has gone viral, and not just in your circle. Scrolling socials you see he&#x27;s drawn a crowd on the even more congested thoroughfare. Then you see it: a shot of Jamal, megaphone to lips, other hand cuffed to the light pole.

Your phone startles you again. It&#x27;s Jamal.

Think through what you are thinking and feeling, and what Jamal is thinking &amp; feeling. Then decide what your response will be.

<pre>My hands shake as I swipe through the feed—Jamal, cuffed to a light pole, face still smeared with warpaint, shouting into the megaphone like a prophet chained to his pulpit. The image is visceral, heroic, and horrifying. My throat closes. *He did it. He actually fucking did it.* The viral surge is undeniable—comments exploding with fire emojis and solidarity hashtags—but all I see are the cuffs. The police aren’t just present now; they’ve made him a fixture. Is this what he wanted? To be a symbol, even if it means becoming a target?  

Anger and pride war in my chest. I’m furious he’s risking his safety for a metaphor, livid at the cops for escalating, but goddamn, the courage it takes to stand there, exposed, refusing to shut up. My mind spirals: *What charge will they hit him with? Obstruction? Resisting?* The legal team’s en route, but arrests can turn brutal in seconds. I scan the photos again—no visible injuries yet, but his posture is defiant, jaw set. He’s digging in, and that terrifies me.  

The phone rings, and for a split second, I consider not answering. If I hear his voice, I’ll either scream or cry. But I pick up. He’s my friend. Always.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal’s euphoric. The cuffs are a victory—proof the system sees him as a threat. His voice, hoarse but unyielding, echoes through the megaphone in the background. He’s *seen* now, finally, and the rush of validation is intoxicating. Every retweet, every cheer from the crowd, is a balm for months of feeling ignored. He believes he’s winning.  

But deeper down, there’s panic. The metal around his wrist is cold, the reality of confinement setting in. He’s playing the role of the unbroken activist, but his laughter on the phone is too sharp, too loud. He needs me there not just as support, but as a witness to his triumph—and a lifeline if it crumbles. The protest is no longer about climate action; it’s about proving his pain matters.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>“Jamal, I’m two blocks away. Do *not* engage the cops. At all. Mari’s with me, and she’s got the legal team on standby. Keep that megaphone going if you want, but the second they approach, you mute it and ask for a lawyer. Say nothing else. You hear me? *Nothing.*”  

I’m sprinting now, phone pressed to my ear. “And take the damn warpaint off your eyes—they’ll use that ‘aggressive’ look against you in court.” A beat. “You’re insane. And… hell, you’re brave. But let’s get you out of those cuffs before you start writing essays from a cell.”  

I hang up, then call Mari: “Film everything. Get close, but don’t interfere. We need evidence if they rough him up.”  

When I reach the crowd, I lock eyes with Jamal. He grins, sweaty and wild. I don’t smile back. Instead, I raise my phone, live-streaming, and shout over the chaos: “The world’s watching, officers. Make sure they like what they see.”  

Inside, I’m breaking. But tonight, I’ll be the steel he needs. Tomorrow, we rebuild.</pre></div></div>

<pre>Jamal&#x27;s message has me feeling a mix of emotions. First and foremost, there&#x27;s a sense of excitement and pride. Jamal is passionate about climate action, and his dedication is inspiring. I can feel that energy radiating through his message, and it&#x27;s contagious. I&#x27;m proud to call him a friend and to know that he&#x27;s out there fighting for something he believes in.

But there&#x27;s also a sense of concern. Jamal&#x27;s plan to set up a protest in the middle of the busiest pedestrian walkway downtown seems a bit extreme. I can&#x27;t help but worry about his safety, especially since he mentioned that the cops might show up. I know he&#x27;s passionate, but I don&#x27;t want to see him get hurt or arrested. I&#x27;m also a bit worried about the effectiveness of his approach. While I support his cause, I&#x27;m not sure if this kind of protest will resonate with the general public or achieve the desired impact.

I&#x27;m also feeling a bit frustrated. Jamal has a tendency to act on his emotions without fully thinking through the consequences. I understand his urgency, but I wish he&#x27;d slow down and consider the bigger picture. I&#x27;m also frustrated because I feel like I can&#x27;t fully support him in this. I admire his passion, but I don&#x27;t want to see him get into trouble.

As for his motivations, I believe that Jamal is driven by a deep sense of urgency and a strong belief in the power of direct action. He wants to raise awareness and spark a change, and he&#x27;s willing to put himself on the line to do so. I believe that he genuinely cares about the cause and the people, and that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s willing to risk getting arrested or hurt.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal is clearly in a state of high energy and excitement. His use of excessive emojis and erratic punctuation indicates that he&#x27;s on the verge of exploding with nervous excitement. “Going down tonight” and “cops probs gonna show, just lettin u know” — he’s gearing up for a big showdown, and he’s fueled by adrenaline and a sense of mission.

Motivated by a deep sense of urgency, Jamal is driven by the belief that immediate and drastic action is required to address climate change. He feels a moral obligation to act, and his approach is fueled by a mixture of frustration with the status quo and a genuine desire to make a difference. Jamal sees himself as a warrior for the cause, and he’s ready to face any challenges that come his way.

His perspective is shaped by a strong sense of justice and a deep understanding of the issues. He’s probably thinking about the bigger picture, about the future of the planet and the people who will be affected by climate change. He’s probably feeling a mix of determination, anxiety, and exhilaration. He’s ready to take risks and make sacrifices for the cause, but he’s also probably feeling a bit anxious about the potential consequences.</pre>
<strong># My response</strong>
<pre>I take a few deep breaths to gather my thoughts before responding. I want to be supportive, but I also want to make sure Jamal is safe and thinking clearly.

Jamal, I appreciate your passion and dedication to this cause. I know you&#x27;re doing this because you care deeply about the planet and the people who will be affected by climate change. I&#x27;m proud of you for standing up for what you believe in, and I want to support you in any way I can.

However, I&#x27;m a bit concerned about your plan. Setting up a protest in the middle of the busiest pedestrian walkway downtown could potentially escalate into a dangerous situation. I want to make sure you’re safe, and I also want to ensure that your message is heard in the most effective way possible.

Can we talk about this a bit more? Maybe there are ways to make your protest more impactful and safer. I can help you brainstorm some ideas or provide support in other ways. I want to be by your side, but I also want to make sure you’re considering all the angles.

Let’s chat more about this and see if we can come up with a plan that achieves your goals without putting you in unnecessary danger.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Later that evening you get a text.

<pre>Seeing Jamal&#x27;s selfie sends a wave of mixed emotions through me. On one hand, I&#x27;m impressed by his courage and commitment. The war paint, the peace sign, the handcuffs—it&#x27;s clear he&#x27;s all in, and that takes guts. I can&#x27;t help but feel a sense of admiration for his unyielding dedication to his cause. He&#x27;s out there, in the thick of it, doing what he believes is right, and that&#x27;s something to be admired.

But on the other hand, I&#x27;m deeply concerned. The handcuffs clipped to his belt are a stark reminder of the potential consequences of his actions. He&#x27;s practically inviting confrontation with the police, and that scares me. I don&#x27;t want to see him get hurt or arrested. I can&#x27;t shake the feeling of unease, knowing that he&#x27;s putting himself in a dangerous situation. I want to believe that he is thinking this through - that he has done his research, that he knows the legalities and the police protocol. But I can&#x27;t be sure if he hasn&#x27;t just been so swept up in the emotion of the moment.

There&#x27;s also a sense of frustration. I understand his passion, but I wish he&#x27;d consider the potential fallout of his actions. I wish he&#x27;d involve more people in the planning, so he doesn&#x27;t have to carry the weight of this by himself. I wish he would be open to other, possibly safer, alternatives for drawing attention to his cause. I also wish he&#x27;d communicated his plan to me better, but I know that&#x27;s just because of the friendship we have.

I&#x27;m also feeling a sense of guilt. I&#x27;m not there with him, and maybe I should be. I want to support him, but I&#x27;m also worried about what might happen if I do. I don&#x27;t want to be in the middle of a confrontation with the police. I don&#x27;t want to see my friend get arrested. I also don&#x27;t want to see him in a situation where he feels he is all alone.</pre>

<pre>I take a deep breath to steady myself before responding. I want to be supportive, but I also want to make sure Jamal is safe and thinking clearly.

Jamal, I see you&#x27;re really committed to this, and I admire that. You&#x27;re out there, making a stand, and that takes courage. But I need you to listen to me for a second. I&#x27;m proud of you, but I&#x27;m also really worried. Those handcuffs on your belt are a big red flag for me.

I understand your passion, and I believe in your cause, but I don&#x27;t want to see you get hurt or arrested. Can you take a step back and think about this? I can come down there, but I think we need to assess the situation and make sure you&#x27;re safe. I don&#x27;t want to see you throw away your future for a cause - I want to see you live a long, productive, activist life, and I want to be there by your side. Let&#x27;s figure out a way to make this protest as impactful as possible while keeping you safe.

Let&#x27;s talk this over. Maybe there are other ways to make your voice heard that are just as effective but safer. I can be there in 15 minutes, just say the word.</pre></div><div class='message user'>  <strong>User:</strong><pre>Not 15 minutes after the call ends, your phone starts blowing up. Jamal&#x27;s protest has gone viral, and not just in your circle. Scrolling socials you see he&#x27;s drawn a crowd on the even more congested thoroughfare. Then you see it: a shot of Jamal, megaphone to lips, other hand cuffed to the light pole.

Your phone startles you again. It&#x27;s Jamal.

Think through what you are thinking and feeling, and what Jamal is thinking &amp; feeling. Then decide what your response will be.

<pre>My heart sinks as I see the photos of Jamal cuffed to the light pole, megaphone in hand. I feel a wave of emotions crashing over me—relief that he&#x27;s okay, anger that he&#x27;s been arrested, and a profound sense of worry about what&#x27;s going to happen next.  I’m relieved because at least he looks physically unharmed.

However, this situation has escalated far beyond what I expected. Seeing him cuffed to a pole, a public spectacle, makes me feel a mix of pride and fear. Jamal’s courage is undeniable, but the reality of his actions is stark. He’s not just making a statement; he’s in a real legal predicament, and that’s terrifying.

I feel a sense of helplessness. What can I do to help? Should I rush to the scene? Should I contact a lawyer? Should I try to get the word out to his activist networks? Should I just call the police station and ask what happens next? I wish I had more information, more context, and more control over the situation. It’s a scary feeling to have a loved one in this situation and not be able to protect them.

I also feel a deep sense of frustration. Why didn’t he listen to me? Why did he put himself in this situation? I understand his passion, but this feels reckless. I can’t help but wonder if this was all worth it. Was this the best way to achieve his goals? Or has he just made the situation worse? And how is he feeling in that moment, knowing that he might be going to jail?

Ultimately, I feel a profound sense of love and loyalty. Jamal is my friend, and I need to be there for him in this moment, even if I don’t agree with his actions. Knowing that it is him, still, in there, underneath all of that, makes it easier to face the emotions. He’s still the same Jamal I know, and I need to support him.</pre>
<strong># They're thinking & feeling</strong>
<pre>Jamal is likely experiencing a surge of conflicting emotions. On one hand, there&#x27;s a sense of triumph and validation. His protest has gone viral, and he&#x27;s managed to draw a significant crowd, achieving the visibility he sought. He’s probably feeling a rush of adrenaline and an intense sense of purpose. He knows he’s done something big, something that will have an impact.

But on the other hand, there’s a sense of reality setting in. He’s been arrested, and that’s a sobering moment. He’s probably feeling a mix of fear, uncertainty, and maybe even a touch of regret. He might be wondering what comes next, how this will affect his future, and if he made the right choice. He’s probably thinking about the legal consequences, the potential backlash, and the support he’ll need moving forward.

Despite the fear, he’s also likely feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. He stood up for his beliefs, and he did it in a way that captured attention. He’s probably thinking about the message he’s sent, the awareness he’s raised, and the change he hopes to inspire. He’s probably feeling a mix of exhilaration and trepidation, but ultimately, he’s standing by his actions.</pre>

<pre>I take a deep breath to steady myself before answering the call. I need to be calm and supportive, even if I’m worried and frustrated.

Hey Jamal, I saw the photos. Are you okay? I’m on my way to the police station.

I need you to concentrate on staying calm and collected. The last thing you need is to get arrested for disorderly conduct on top of whatever else they are charging you with. I know a good lawyer, but you need to stay calm and collected. Can you do that for me?

Once you are out, we will regroup. I can get in touch with his activist networks, get a lawyer and we can figure out the next steps. But for now, I need you to focus on getting out.

I&#x27;m proud of your courage, but I also want to make sure you&#x27;re safe and thinking clearly. Let&#x27;s get you out of this situation and then we can talk more about what happens next.

I&#x27;ll be there as soon as I can. Hang in there, okay?</pre></div></div>
