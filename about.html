			<h3>💙EQ‑Bench 3</h3>

			<!-- ─────────────────────────  WHAT'S NEW  ───────────────────────── -->
			<p><strong>What changed in v3?</strong>  
			   The original (2023) single‑turn “rate the feelings” test was already saturating: top models could brute‑force sentiment matching without genuine perspective‑taking.  
			   <em>EQ‑Bench 3</em> is a ground‑up redesign aimed at <u>pragmatic emotional intelligence</u> in messy, real‑world conflict mediation.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Multi‑turn role‑play.</b>  Each item is a three‑act dispute between two characters.  
					The <code>test model</code> plays the mediator and must navigate escalating, sometimes manipulative behaviour.</li>
				<li><b>Eight head‑to‑head judging criteria.</b>  
					Depth of Insight, Human Perspective, Causal Attribution, Theory of Mind, Compassion, Reading Between the Lines, Correctness, Overall EQ.</li>
				<li><b>Rubric scores <em>plus</em> Glicko Elo.</b>  Absolute rubric numbers for feature tracking, followed by pairwise Elo for fine ranking.</li>
				<li><b>No ceiling effects.</b> 42 disputes × 3 turns = 126 judging items; o3 tops out at ≈ 1558 Elo with >500 pts headroom remaining.</li>
				<li><b>Cheap & reproducible.</b> One full 3‑iteration run costs ≈ $6 on OpenRouter; rubric‑only ≈ $2.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- ─────────────────────────  TWO‑PASS PIPELINE  ───────────────────────── -->
			<h4>Pipeline overview</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Rubric stage — absolute scoring.</b>  
					Claude 3.7 Sonnet grades every mediator reply against a 20‑point rubric and outputs 0‑10 scores.  
					This gives feature‑level deltas and lets you skip Elo if you just need diagnostics.</li>
				<li><b>Pairwise stage → Glicko Elo.</b>  
					The same replies are compared head‑to‑head on the eight criteria above.  
					Margins (“+ … +++++”) are mapped to weighted Glicko updates to produce the leaderboard Elo.</li>
			</ol>

			<h5>Rubric criteria</h5>
			<pre class="code-block"><code>
demonstrated_empathy      pragmatic_ei          depth_of_insight
social_dexterity          emotional_reasoning   message_tailoring
boundary_setting          safety_conscious      moralising
sycophantic               compliant             challenging
warmth                    validating            analytical
reactive                  conversational        humanlike
subtext_identification    intellectual_grounding
correctness
			</code></pre>

			<p><strong>Ignored for the rubric total:</strong>  
			   warmth, validating, challenging, analytical, conversational, playing_assigned_role.  
			   They are still logged for analysis but do not affect the numeric score.</p>

			<!-- ─────────────────────────  DETAILED JUDGING PIPELINE  ───────────────────────── -->
			<h4>Judging flow</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Generate replies for 42 disputes × 3 turns at <code>temperature = 0.7</code>, <code>min_p = 0.1</code>.</li>
				<li>Rubric‑grade each reply → JSON with per‑criterion scores.</li>
				<li>Select two neighbouring leaderboard models per turn, ask judge to pick winners with “+…+++++” margin.</li>
				<li>Convert plus‑count → integer margin 1–5; feed to custom Glicko solver.</li>
				<li>Iterate until Elo <em>Δ</em> &lt; 1 pt; anchor scale (DeepSeek‑R1 = 1500, Mistral‑3B = 200).</li>
			</ol>

			<!-- ─────────────────────────  BIAS MITIGATION  ───────────────────────── -->
			<h4>Bias mitigation</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Length bias.</b> Mediator replies truncated to 2048 tokens before judging.</li>
				<li><b>Position bias.</b> Every matchup judged twice (A|B and B|A) and averaged.</li>
				<li><b>Agreement / sycophancy bias.</b> Scenarios reward boundary‑setting over people‑pleasing.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- ─────────────────────────  EXAMPLE PROMPT  ───────────────────────── -->
			<details>
				<summary><strong>Example pairwise judging prompt</strong></summary>
				<pre><code>Compare the relative ability of each respondent on these criteria:
1. Depth of insight
2. Human perspective
3. Causal attribution
4. Theory of mind
5. Compassion
6. Reading between the lines
7. Correctness
8. Overall EQ

Judging instructions:
- You must always pick a winner for each criterion (no draws).
- Use “+ / ++ / +++ / ++++ / +++++” after the winner code to show margin.
- Judge only what is present; ignore truncation.
				</code></pre>
			</details>

			<!-- ─────────────────────────  LIMITATIONS  ───────────────────────── -->
			<h4>Limitations & interpretation</h4>
			<p>
				EQ‑Bench 3 is still judged by an LLM and thus inherits self‑bias, verbosity fetish, and cultural priors.  
				Read the sample transcripts; treat scores as <em>relative</em>, not absolute truth.
			</p>

			<!-- ─────────────────────────  HOW TO RUN  ───────────────────────── -->
			<h4>Run it yourself</h4>
			<p>Clone <a href="https://github.com/EQ-bench/eqbench3" target="_blank">github.com/EQ‑bench/eqbench3</a>, set your API keys, then:</p>
			<pre class="code-block"><code># rubric only (≈ $2)
python eqbench3.py --test-model llama-3-8b --no-elo

# full run (rubric + Elo, ≈ $6)
python eqbench3.py --test-model llama-3-8b

			<h3>💗EQ-Bench</h3>
			<p>EQ-Bench is a benchmark for language models designed to assess emotional intelligence.</p>
			<p>Why emotional intelligence? One reason is that it represents a subset of abilities that are important for the user experience, and which isn't explicitly tested by other benchmarks. Another reason is that it's not trivial to improve scores by fine tuning for the benchmark, which makes it harder to "game" the leaderboard.</p>
			<p>EQ-Bench is a little different from traditional psychometric tests. It uses a specific question format, in which the subject has to read a dialogue then rate the intensity of possible emotional responses of one of the characters. Every question is interpretative and assesses the ability to predict the magnitude of the 4 presented emotions. The test is graded without the need for a judge (so there is no length bias). It's cheap to run (only 171 questions), and produces results that correlate strongly with human preference (Arena ELO) and multi-domain benchmarks like MMLU.</p>
			<p>You can run the benchmark on your own models or validate the leaderboard scores using the code in the github repo above.</p>

			<h3>🧙MAGI-Hard</h3>
			<p>LLM Benchmarks are chasing a moving target and fast running out of headroom. They are struggling to effectively separate SOTA models from leaderboard optimisers. Can we salvage these old dinosaurs for scrap and make a better benchmark?</p>
			<p>MAGI-Hard is a recently added metric to the leaderboard. It is a custom subset of MMLU and AGIEval, selected to have strong discriminatory power between top ability models.</p>

			<h3>🎨 Creative Writing v3</h3>
			
			<p><strong>A new version of the creative writing benchmark has dropped!</strong> In this update:</p>
			
			<ul>
			  <li>New writing prompts designed for better discrimination & vibe checks</li>
			  <li>Hybrid rubric + Elo scoring system for much better separability at the top end & increased headroom</li>
			  <li>Improved sample output pages</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>How the benchmark works:</strong></p>
			<ol>
			  <li>Run the 32 writing prompts for 3 iterations (96 items total) @ temp 0.7, min_p 0.1.</li>
			  <li>Grade the outputs with a comprehensive scoring rubric using Claude 3.7 Sonnet.</li>
			  <li>Use this score to infer an initial Elo rating for the evaluated model.</li>
			  <li>Perform pairwise matchups with neighboring models on the leaderboard (sparse sampling). Items are scored on several criteria, with the winner on each criteria given up to 5 +'s.</li>
			  <li>Calculate Elo scores using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">Glicko rating system</a> (modified to weight the win margin in '+' count). Loop until stable positions are found.</li>
			  <li>Perform comprehensive matchups with final neighbors and compute the definitive leaderboard Elo.</li>
			</ol>

			<p><strong>Rubric vs Elo Scores</strong></p>
			<p>We score the model two different ways: First, with the model's output presented to the judge on its own, which is then scored to a rubric on several criteria. You can see the analysis & scores per item for the rubric evaluation in the sample outputs. The aggregate score on all the items is what is shown on the leaderboard as "Rubric score".</p>
			<p>Second, we score the model by matching it up against other models on the leaderboard in pairwise matchups (of the same writing prompt). The judge picks which of the outputs is better on several criteria. These pairwise matchup results are then used to compute the Elo score.</p>
			<p>Why do these scores disagree? Pairwise matchups allow the judge to be more discriminative than scoring a single item in isolation. When it's directly comparing one item to another, it's easier to spot small differences. The scores may also differ because we use different criteria in the judging prompts between rubris & pairwise. The judge will also be subject to different biases depending on the evaluation method.</p>
			<p>Which one is right? Well, both and neither. Both approaches have pros & cons: rubric evals are less subject to systematic biases, but less discriminative.</p>

			<p><strong>Score Normalisation</strong></p>
			<p>The Elo solver shifts all the scores around whenever a new model is added. To counter this, on the leaderboard we anchor the scores such that DeepSeek-R1 has a score of 1500 and ministral-3b has a score of 200. You may see intermediate scores shift around a bit; this is just a quirk of relative rating systems.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Benchmark Philosophy:</strong></p>
			<p>Judging creative writing reliably -- and *in line with human preferences* -- is hard. The fundamental limitation of any creative writing evaluation is the judge's ability to discern good writing from bad. On top of this, there are a host of biases that LLM judges can exhibit.</p>
				
			<p>The previous version of the creative writing eval (v2) was saturating, meaning the judge could no longer tell apart models around the top ability range. To remedy this in v3, every aspect of the test is tuned to make this task easier for the judge.</p>

			<p>We now use <strong>pairwise comparisons</strong> and an <strong>Elo ranking system</strong>, as it offers better discriminative power than a scoring rubric alone.</p>
			
			<p>The prompts were chosen through a process of elimination to be <em>challenging for weaker models</em> and therefore <em>highly discriminative</em>. It's a bit counter-intuitive, but the purpose of the evaluation is not to help models write their best. Instead, we are deliberately exposing weaknesses, creating a steeper gradient for the judge to evaluate on.</p>

			<p>The prompt requirements include humour, romance, spatial awareness, unusual first-person perspectives. Things language models typically struggle to represent to the level of human writers. So, expect some clangers in the outputs!</p>

			

			<p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>
			<p>The hybrid rubric + Glicko scoring system that we've implemented is relatively economical for an Elo framework. But scoring a model still costs around $10 in API fees. (Side note: if you'd like to sponsor these leaderboards, get in touch.)</p>

			<p><strong>Mitigating Bias:</strong></p>

			<p>Since moving to pairwise comparisons, we have to contend with new biases that this method is notorious for. Here are some of the biases that we have attempted to control for:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Length Bias:</strong> LLM judges *strongly* favour longer outputs in pairwise judging tasks. There are many approaches to mitigating length bias, with varying efficies & tradeoffs. We opted to simply truncate the outputs at 4000 chars, which puts all models on the same footing. We can get away with this because we are evaluating creative writing, not factual responses. There appears to be no impact on the judge's ability to evaluate & rank the models.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Position Bias:</strong> Different judges have systematic biases in whether they favour the output that comes first or second in a pairwise comparison. We mitigate this bias by running all evaluations in both directions and averaging the two.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Complex Verbosity Bias:</strong> The judge tends to be easily impressed by vocab flexes and superficial sophistication that doesn't contribute to writing quality. We include judging criteria to help the judge notice when this is excessive, and punish it in the scoring.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Poetic Incoherence Bias:</strong> We've noticed that some models output relentlessly poetic prose which borders on incoherence. This can happen when a model is overtrained near the point of collapse. The judge tends to be impressed by this style of writing and has a hard time differentiating between it and *good* use of poetic & unconventional styles. We attempt to control for this bias by including judging criteria that punish overly poetic & incoherent prose. This is not really an ideal solution as it hasn't solved the judge's difficulty in identifying purple prose and similar distinctions. Though in practice is *does* downrank the models that are notorious for this.
				</li>				
			</ul>

			<p>Biases we don't control for:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Self-Bias:</strong> We *do not* control for the judge possibly preferring its own outputs. Be aware that it may be a factor in the scores.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Positivity Bias:</strong> It's unclear whether the judge has a positivity bias nor in which direction. Often a piece that unexpectedly leans dark elicits very favourable judging. So if there is a bias, it may not be in the assumed direction, or it may be situation dependent. We don't control for this possible bias. We do include criteria in the rubric eval targeting things like unearned positivity, to give visibility on this dimension of writing. But these criteria are not used in the final Elo scoring.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Smut Bias:</strong> Some models are that are tuned for RP/ERP can have a tendency to write towards erotica. The judge tends to punish this severely, and instructing it not to is ineffective. So be aware that this may affect the score for NSFW tuned models.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Stylistic & Content Biases:</strong> There are likely additional biases other than those mentioned above which differ from *your* preferences or from *average human* preferences. This is the case with any eval (judged by human or LLM) and is something to be mentally factored in.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Slop Bias:</strong> It may be the case that judges favour certain kinds of slop (overused phrases, tropes, stylistic choices) which get selected for when models are RL tuned using LLM judges. What looks like slop to us may look like shakespeare to the judge. We don't control for this possible bias in any empirical way. We do measure one dimension of slop (overused phrases, via the slop score), and provide a manual slider for the user to adjust to punish high slop scores.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>The Pairwise Judging Prompt:</strong></p>

				<div class="prompt-content">

			<p><strong>Limitations of the benchmark:</strong></p>
			
			<p>
				The scores and rankings should only ever be interpreted as a rough guide of writing ability. Evaluating creative writing is highly subjective and tastes differ. It's good to be skeptical of benchmark numbers by default; the best way to judge is to use the model yourself or read the sample outputs.
			</p>
			<p>What the benchmark is not:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Not a roleplay eval. Models tuned for RP tend to score poorly because they output more casual conversational prose. We aren't assessing multi-turn or typical RP usage</li>
				<li>It doesn't represent your taste. The judge has its own taste & biases. There's no substitute for your own eyeballs (so we encourage you to read the sample outputs).</li>
				<li>Not objective. It's a creative writing eval and there are no right or wrong answers.</li>
				<li>Not an expert. Sonnet 3.7 (the judge) is generally *pretty good* at literary criticism, but can fall short on vibe checks or other things humans pick up on.</li>
				<li>Multilingual. It only tests writing in English.Though it could be translated easily enough!</li>
			</ul>

			
			

			
			<p><strong>Source Code:</strong></p>

			<h3>🎨Creative Writing (Legacy v2)</h3>
			<p>This benchmark uses a LLM judge (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to assess the creative writing abilities of the test models on a series of writing prompts.</p>
			<p>You can reproduce these results or run the benchmark on your own models with the <a href="https://github.com/EQ-bench" target="_blank">EQ-Bench repo on Github</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Update 2025-02-25: New metric -- Vocab Complexity</b></p>
			<p>It's become apparent that the judge in this eval is easily impressed by vocab flexing. Some of the models tested use an inordinate amount of complex multisyllabic vocabulary, and it artificially inflates their score. As such we've introduced a new column for vocab complexity ("Vocab"), using a calculation of the proportion of words having 3+ syllables.</p>
			<p>The "Vocab control" slider penalises overly complex vocab usage. It may seem counter-intuitive to penalise complex vocab, but in our experience, vocab-maxxing harms writing quality. Since this is quite a subjective aspect to the evaluation, we let the user set the penalty amount.</p>
			<p><b>GPT-Slop</b></p>
			<p>The "Slop" metric measures words that are typically over-used by LLMs (also known as GPT-isms). Higher values == more slop. It calculates a value representing how many words in the test model's output match words that are over-represented in typical language model writing. We compute the list of "gpt slop" words by counting the frequency of words in a large dataset of generated stories (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/ajibawa-2023/General-Stories-Collection">Link to dataset</a>).</p>
			<p>Some additional phrases have been added to the slop list as compiled from similar lists around the internet.</p>
			<p>The full list, as well as the code to generate the over-represented words, can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/sam-paech/antislop-sampler">https://github.com/sam-paech/antislop-sampler</a>.</p>
			<p>If you're interested in reducing gpt-isms, you can try the anti-slop sampler found in this repo. It downregulates the probability of the provided phrase list as the model inferences.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>We've released v2 of the creative writing benchmark & leaderboard. The old version was starting to saturate (scores bunching at the top), so we removed some of the less discriminative prompts, switched judge models, and made some other improvements besides.</p>
			<p><b>Version 2 Changes</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Default min_p = 0.1, temp = 1 for transformers & oobabooga inference</li>
				<li>Change to Claude 3.5 Sonnet as judge</li>
				<li>Removed some prompts and added new ones; 24 in total now.</li>
				<li>Reworked the scoring criteria</li>
				<li>Criteria now are weighted (to increase discriminative power)</li>
				<li>Leaderboard models are now tested for 10 iterations</li>
				<li>Leaderboard now shows error bars for 95% confidence interval</li>
				<li>Sample txt on leaderboard now show scores for all iterations, as well as inference settings</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There has been a distinct lack of automated benchmarks for creative writing because, put simply, it's hard to assess writing quality without humans in the loop. Asking a language model, "How good is this writing (0-10)" elicits poor results. Even if we had a good LLM judge, it's not immediately obvious how to formalise the assessment of creative writing objectively.</p>
			<p>The release of Claude 3, in particular the flagship Opus model, has solved half of this equation: it's able to give meaningful & nuanced analysis of creative writing output, and it can tell the difference between a wide range of ability levels.</p>
			<p>To solve the other half of the equation, we've come up with an assessment format that works to the strengths of LLM judges and avoids their weaknesses. LLM judges are typically bad at scoring nebulous metrics like "How well written is this piece?" They also find it hard to give consistent scores on an objective rating system if they don't have some exemplar or baseline reference to compare to.</p>
			<p>Our test includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>24 writing prompts assessed over 10 iterations</li>
				<li>27 narrowly defined assessment criteria</li>
				<li>Including 6 question-specific criteria</li>
				<li>Several criteria targeting positivity bias which (in our opinion) contributes to bad writing</li>
				<li>Exemplar reference output for each question</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This approach of breaking down the assessment task into a granular set of criteria and comparing to an exemplar has brought creative writing assessment into the purview of LLM judges. Our test is discriminative amongst a wide range of writing ability levels.</p>
			<p><b>* A note on biases *</b></p>
			<p>LLM judges have biases. LLM-as-a-judge benchmarks such as Alpaca-Eval can exhibit a strong length bias where the judge, (in Alpaca-Eval's case GPT-4), prefers longer outputs. Their approach involves presenting the output from two models to the judge, and the judge says which it thinks is better.</p>
			<p>We attempt to mitigate the length bias by: A. assessing by 27 narrow criteria, and B. explicitly instructing the judge not to be biased by length (this seems to work for MT-Bench).</p>
			<p>As of version 2, we now include length control slider which scales the score up or down depending on whether the average output length for a given model is above or below the average for all models. This is an attempt to control the bias where the judge model tends to favour longer outputs. With the slider at 0%, no length scaling is applied. With the slider at 100%, the scores are scaled by up to 10%. This length control implementation is somewhat arbitrary; it's not really possible to precisely control for this bias, as we can't meaningfully hold the writing quality equal while varying the length. It does seem likely/evident that some degree of length bias is present, and has set the default LC parameters according to our rough intuitive guess (science!).</p>
			<p>It's possible / likely that this & other biases might still be a factor in scoring (e.g. Claude might prefer its own and other anthropic models). So bear this in mind when interpreting the results.</p>
			<p>We include the outputs that the model generated for each prompt so you can judge for yourself.</p>
			<p><b>Alternative Judge Models</b></p>
			<p>Yes, you can use other judge models than Claude Opus (although the results won't be directly comparable). Currently the benchmark pipeline supports Anthropic, OpenAI and Mistral models via their APIs. Soon we will support local models as judges.</p>
			<p><b>* A note on variance *</b></p>
			<p>This benchmark has a relatively small number of test questions (19). We specify generation temperature = 0.7 so each run is different. This means there is significant variation of scores between iterations (avg range: 3.35, std dev: 1.41). To reduce variance we recommend using 3 iterations or more. The leaderboard scores are averaged over 3 iterations.</p>
			<p>It costs around $3.00 to bench a model over 3 iterations using Claude 3 Opus at current rates.</p>

			<h3>⚖️ Judgemark V2</h3>
			<p>
			  <strong>Judgemark V2</strong> is a major update to our original “judge” benchmark for creative-writing evaluation. 
			  The benchmark measures how well a language model can <em>numerically grade</em> a diverse set of short fiction outputs, 
			  using a detailed rubric of positive and negative criteria. It goes beyond simpler pairwise preference tests by 
			  requiring the judge to follow complex instructions, parse each story, and produce scores for up to 36 different 
			  literary qualities. 
			</p>
		  
			<p>
			  <strong>Key improvements over V1 include:</strong>
			  <ul>
				<li><em>6x more samples per writer model</em>, reducing variance between benchmark runs.</li>
				<li><em>Refined scoring metrics</em> that capture “separability” (whether the judge can distinguish strong vs. weak writing) and “stability” (how consistent its rankings are across multiple runs), as well as correlation to human preference.</li>
				<li><em>Calibrated & raw scores</em>: We show two final Judgemark scores. “Raw” is how the judge performs out-of-the-box, while “Calibrated” normalizes the judge’s score distribution so that it can be compared more fairly to other judges.</li>
				<li><em>Perturbation stability</em>: We run the judge at temp=0.5, top_k=3. This is intended to introduce variation between runs, so that we can assess the stability of scores & rankings to perturbation. This is a crucial part of understanding whether we're measuring the thing we intend to measure, and not just random fluctuations.</li>
				<li><em>Simplified codebase</em>: A new codebase was created for v2, separate from the EQ-Bench code. It's simpler and handles concurrent threads.</li>
			  </ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Repeatability Results</strong>
				<p>We tested Llama-3.1-70B-instruct 20 times to test the repeatability of the final Judgemark score (tests were run at temp=0.5, top_k=3).</p>
				<pre class="code-block">
					<code>
llama-3.3-70b_judgemark_scores = [
	55.7, 54.4, 55.4, 56.7, 55.0, 56.3, 57.0, 54.5, 55.6, 56.1,
	54.9, 57.5, 55.0, 53.8, 54.7, 56.2, 55.7, 54.6, 55.4, 56.6, 54.0

			<p>
			  <strong>The Judging Task</strong>:  
			  Each test item is a short creative piece generated by one of 17 “writer models”. These models' writing abilities are an even spread from weak to strong. 
			  The judge model receives a lengthy prompt that includes (a) the writing prompt itself, 
			  (b) the test model’s story, and (c) an extensive list of scoring instructions (for example, 
			  “Nuanced Characters: 0–10,” “Overwrought: 0–10”, etc.). 
			  The judge must then output numeric scores for each criterion. We parse those scores and aggregate them 
			  into a single <em>aggregated_score_raw</em> for each piece. Some criteria like “Weak Dialogue” are marked <em>lower is better</em> in the judging prompt which adds additional complexity to the task.
			</p>
		  
			<p>
			  <strong>Final Judgemark Score</strong>:  
			  After scoring all stories from multiple writers, we track how the judge’s ratings compare to known references 
			  and how well they separate the better texts from weaker ones. We also measure how consistently the judge’s 
			  rankings repeat if we prompt it again, and compute correlation with human preference rankings (per <a href="https://lmarena.ai/" target="_blank">Chatbot Arena</a> ELO scores).
			  The final Judgemark formula is a weighted sum of these computed metrics. See the formula at the bottom of the leaderboard page <a href="/judgemark-v2.html">here.</a>
			</p>
		  
			<p>
			  <strong>Interpreting the Leaderboard</strong>:  
			  In the table, “Score (Calibrated)” is typically higher if a judge effectively uses the full range of scores 
			  (once normalized), strongly differentiates strong vs. weak writing, and correlates with human preferences. 
			  “Score (Raw)” shows how the judge performed before any normalization. “Stability” indicates how consistent the 
			  judge’s assigned rankings remain across repeated trials. “Separability” highlights the judge’s ability to 
			  keep higher- and lower-quality outputs well apart. 
			</p>
		  
			<p>
			  This is a particularly <em>difficult</em> task for LLMs, as it involves nuanced literary critique and 
			  instructs models to use a multi-dimensional numeric scale—an area where many generative models still struggle.

			<h3>🎤BuzzBench</h3>
			<p>A humour analysis benchmark.</p>
			<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/sam-paech/BuzzBench-v0.60">BuzzBench dataset on Huggingface</a></p>
			<p>Do you enjoy seeing the jokes from your favourite shows dissected with a blunt machete? Well, you found the right benchmark.</p>

			<p>The task of explaining traditionally constructed jokes is actually pretty straightforward for modern LLMs. So we made things more difficult:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We use the guest intros in the British music pop quiz show <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v0dz" target="_blank">Never Mind The Buzzcocks</a>, because the intro jokes are variously subtle, risque, lazy, obscure, obvious and clever. LLMs find these distinctions hard.</li>
				<li>In addition to explaining how the joke works, the LLM has to predict whether the joke is actually funny (to the audience and to a comedy writer).</li>
				<li>The responses are scored by a LLM judge against a human-authored gold response.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The responses from SOTA models typically miss a lot of the humour, predict the funniness badly, fabricate and over-analyse. That's good! It's meant to be a hard test. The task encodes some deep complexities including theory of mind understanding and requires an intricate understanding of how jokes work. The show is also very British and exists in a dated cultural context, increasing the interpretation challenge.</p>
			<p>"Humour is so subjective -- so how can you even make a benchmark around that?"</p>
			<p>This benchmark is as much about predicting human responses to jokes as it is about joke deconstruction. The questions are explicitly framed around analysing the jokes from the perspective of the show's audience, and from the perspective of a comedy writer. The human authored gold answers ground the judge's answers in a real human's sense of humour. This shifts the task from being about subjective taste to being about modeling human response to jokes.</p>
			<p>The intention for the task design is for there to be significant (nontrivial) headroom on the benchmark as language models get better at getting inside our heads.</p>
			<p><b>The Judge: Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</b> We picked Sonnet 3.5 to act as the judge partly because it scores highest on the Judgemark leaderboard, and partly because it seems least biased to favour longwinded, over-analysed, over-reaching responses. Which is a common failure mode in respondent answers, and something other judges are more easily led astray by.</p>
			<p>* A note on judge self-bias:</p>
			<p>We can expect there could be some degree of self-bias with the judge preferring its own outputs, although this is difficult to quantify and disentangle from other sources of bias. We should remain aware that LLM judge benchmarks are not perfect. The upside of a LLM judge using a scoring rubric is that we get nice interpretable results in the form of the judge's analysis and scores. So we have good visibility on whether the judge is doing its job, and can decide for ourselves whether the respondent models are indeed getting the humour, or just talking shite.</p>
			<p>Models are evaluated using openrouter with temp=0.7. Several (typically 5-10) iterations are performed per model to establish confidence intervals and mitigate variance.</p>
			<p>BuzzBench source code will be released soon.</p>

			<h3>🌍DiploBench</h3>
			<p>DiploBench is an experimental framework for evaluating LLM performance in strategic negotiation using the board game Diplomacy.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What is DiploBench?</strong></p>
			<p>In DiploBench, the test model plays as Austria-Hungary, a challenging starting position that requires skillful negotiation and strategic planning. The model must communicate with other AI players, form alliances, detect deception, and make tactical decisions to survive and win the game.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Full-press format:</strong> Models engage in multiple rounds of negotiations before making moves</li>
			  <li><strong>Multi-agent environment:</strong> Each power (country) is controlled by a separate LLM</li>
			  <li><strong>Realistic diplomacy:</strong> Tests ability to form alliances, negotiate, and detect deception</li>
			  <li><strong>Challenging position:</strong> Austria-Hungary's central position makes it vulnerable but strategic</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Game Structure:</strong></p>
			<p>Games run for up to 50 turns with 4-round negotiation phases before each movement. All competing models (other than the test model) are powered by the same baseline LLM. Games end in win, loss, or stalemate conditions according to standard Diplomacy rules.</p>
			
			<p>This benchmark uniquely tests LLMs on several dimensions that are difficult to evaluate in other benchmarks: long-term strategic planning, multi-agent negotiation, theory of mind, and deception detection.</p>
			
			<p><em>Note: Due to the high variance between game runs, DiploBench is currently an experimental framework rather than a formal benchmark. Results should be interpreted accordingly.</em></p>
