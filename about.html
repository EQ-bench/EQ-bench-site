			<p><b>💗EQ-Bench</b></p>
			<p>EQ-Bench is a benchmark for language models designed to assess emotional intelligence.</p>
			<p>Why emotional intelligence? One reason is that it represents a subset of abilities that are important for the user experience, and which isn't explicitly tested by other benchmarks. Another reason is that it's not trivial to improve scores by fine tuning for the benchmark, which makes it harder to "game" the leaderboard.</p>
			<p>EQ-Bench is a little different from traditional psychometric tests. It uses a specific question format, in which the subject has to read a dialogue then rate the intensity of possible emotional responses of one of the characters. Every question is interpretative and assesses the ability to predict the magnitude of the 4 presented emotions. The test is graded without the need for a judge (so there is no length bias). It's cheap to run (only 171 questions), and produces results that correlate strongly with human preference (Arena ELO) and multi-domain benchmarks like MMLU.</p>
			<p>You can run the benchmark on your own models or validate the leaderboard scores using the code in the github repo above.</p>
			<p>If you would like to see a model on the leaderboard, get in touch and suggest it!</p>

			<p><b>🧙MAGI-Hard</b></p>
			<p>LLM Benchmarks are chasing a moving target and fast running out of headroom. They are struggling to effectively separate SOTA models from leaderboard optimisers. Can we salvage these old dinosaurs for scrap and make a better benchmark?</p>
			<p>MAGI-Hard is a recently added metric to the leaderboard. It is a custom subset of MMLU and AGIEval, selected to have strong discriminatory power between top ability models.</p>
			<p>Read more <a href="https://sampaech.substack.com/p/creating-magi-a-hard-subset-of-mmlu" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<p><b>🎨Creative Writing</b></p>
			<p>This is a brand new leaderboard which uses a LLM judge (Claude 3 Opus) to assess the creative writing abilities of the test models on a series of writing prompts.</p>
			<p>You can reproduce these results or run the benchmark on your own models with the <a href="https://github.com/EQ-bench/EQ-Bench" target="_blank">EQ-Bench repo on Github</a>.</p>
			<p>There has been a distinct lack of automated benchmarks for creative writing because, put simply, it's hard to assess writing quality without humans in the loop. Asking a language model, "How good is this writing (0-10)" elicits poor results. Even if we had a good LLM judge, it's not immediately obvious how to formalise the assessment of creative writing objectively.</p>
			<p>The release of Claude 3, in particular the flagship Opus model, has solved half of this equation: it's able to give meaningful & nuanced analysis of creative writing output, and it can tell the difference between a wide range of ability levels.</p>
			<p>To solve the other half of the equation, we've come up with an assessment format that works to the strengths of LLM judges and avoids their weaknesses. LLM judges are typically bad at scoring nebulous metrics like "How well written is this piece?" They also find it hard to give consistent scores on an objective rating system if they don't have some exemplar or baseline reference to compare to.</p>
			<p>Our test includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>19 writing prompts (typically assessed over multiple iterations)</li>
				<li>36 narrowly defined assessment criteria</li>
				<li>Including 6 question-specific criteria</li>
				<li>Several criteria targeting positivity bias which (in our opinion) contributes to bad writing</li>
				<li>Exemplar reference output for each question</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This approach of breaking down the assessment task into a granular set of criteria and comparing to an exemplar has brought creative writing assessment into the purview of LLM judges. Our test is discriminative amongst a wide range of writing ability levels.</p>
			<p><b>* A note on biases *</b></p>
			<p>LLM judges have biases. LLM-as-a-judge benchmarks such as Alpaca-Eval can exhibit a strong length bias where the judge, (in Alpaca-Eval's case GPT-4), prefers longer outputs. Their approach involves presenting the output from two models to the judge, and the judge says which it thinks is better.</p>
			<p>We attempt to mitigate the length bias by: A. assessing by 36 narrow criteria, and B. explicitly instructing the judge not to be biased by length (this seems to work for MT-Bench).</p>
			<p>It's possible / likely that this & other biases might still be a factor in scoring (e.g. Claude might prefer its own and other anthropic models). So bear this in mind when interpreting the results.</p>
			<p>We include the outputs that the model generated for each prompt so you can judge for yourself.</p>
			<p><b>Alternative Judge Models</b></p>
			<p>Yes, you can use other judge models than Claude Opus (although the results won't be directly comparable). Currently the benchmark pipeline supports Anthropic, OpenAI and Mistral models via their APIs. Soon we will support local models as judges.</p>
			<p><b>* A note on variance *</b></p>
			<p>This benchmark has a relatively small number of test questions (19). We specify generation temperature = 0.7 so each run is different. This means there is significant variation of scores between iterations (avg range: 3.35, std dev: 1.41). To reduce variance we recommend using 3 iterations or more. The leaderboard scores are averaged over 3 iterations.</p>
			<p>It costs around $3.00 to bench a model over 3 iterations using Claude 3 Opus at current rates.</p>

			<p><b>⚖️Judgemark</b> measures the ability of a model to judge creative writing.</p>
			<p>This is a *hard* test. The benchmark requires the model to judge a series of pre-generated creative writing outputs from 19 test models, assigning scores to each of the test models in the same way that the creative-writing benchmark does it.</p>
			<p>Here's a quick rundown of the metrics:</p>
			<p><em>EQB-Corr:</em> Correlation with EQ-Bench scores.</p>
			<p><em>Arena-Corr:</em> Correlation with LMSys Arena ELO.</p>
			<p><em>Cost:</em> in USD to run the Judgemark benchmark for this model.</p>
			<p><em>Std. Dev.:</em> Standard deviation of scores between the test models. This corresponds to the judge's ability to reliably identify different ability levels over multiple trials.</p>
			<p><em>Self Bias:</em> The deviation from the predicted score when the judge model scores its own output. The bias stats should be taken with a grain of salt as the sample size we've computed them from is quite low.</p>
			<p><em>Family Bias:</em> The deviation from the predicted score when the judge model scores models in its family (e.g. Claude opus scoring sonnet & haiku).</p>
			<p><em>Judgemark:</em> A final aggregate score derived from the correlation & std. dev. stats.</p>
			<p><em>Stats:</em> Test model scores and raw stats from the Judgemark run.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The Judgemark score is computed like this:</p>		
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;([Average of Pearson Correlations normalised 0-1]<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ [Average of Kendall Correlations normalised 0-1]<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ [Std. Dev. normalised 0-1])<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;÷ 3			
			</p>
			<p>The exact normalisation calculation is in lib/judgemark.py of the EQ-Bench pipeline.</p>
			<p>You can run Judgemark with the EQ-Bench pipeline at the github repo linked above.</p>
